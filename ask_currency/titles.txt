Totally gonna sell you
Only we have time
You could get your life together
Wet moving mirror
It takes a village
Right hand on the other sleeve
Walk down the street
The sky looked tender
We call you our lovers
Longtime enemy
Two blows out
Ours is the tale of the Shire
I think someone laid down
On in black
To find myself empty
Lead off with love
None of this mattered
Laugh in our faces
Impress her
Bring me through
His tears won't die
Fearsome little girl
Dead after all
I won’t die in vain
Super-human deal
Lost in the stars
Put them in my hands
Tell me what you think
Everything of good and evil
I will return
Before he died
This is where you belong
I still talk at night
No different
My soul here on earth
And you know it?
Before you know it
A statue made of myself
Somewhere, somewhere inside you
Take the wheel
Finally liberty if you get back on stage
It’s his pleasure
I didn't care about you
Starting with white
I don't need you anymore
Head from the future
Ask anybody
Where I sit from now on
Through the gate
You’ve got no right to complain
Love still burns
To know my innermost thoughts
And stay away
You watched me hide in a corner
No foundation
You found your way in
Got a little girl now
Never do
Dealt your heart
And the room
When you leave me now
I will shake
Common cause
Throw sand out of her eyes
All I ever knew
The saddest day
Flowing water in your hand
Every indecision comes nearer
No one’s fucking with me
You are going crazy
Wished for God
To her ecstasy
It won't take long to sing
Up and out
I’m ready for this
Love for the soul
Cruel red country
The speed with which time keeps repeating
Brother
Say all you want
Had to surrender
Hang over me like a bat
Old Alabama
Don’t have it hard
A habit to exist
Now there are some more
Pictures to show
When I’m like this
I hope we'll be together soon
This is the future
Switch to a different flavor
Sculptures of deceit
Time for a question
Spring like here
That’s what life is all about
Give everything to somebody
I don’t want to be you
Time passes
Right back up
A letter from you
A wine vase
I will feel
A storm in the news
Reaching out for another kiss
Little precious stone
Allow me to keep you waiting
When I last saw you
Treasure in a glass jar
Watching themselves fade
I don’t care to be
When you didn’t belong
The rich and famous
In all the glory of his face
Inside of you
My fine friends
Gimme their melody
Everybody’s laughing
Everybody wants to ride
Ride like a butterfly
And to be so naive
It’s unmade
Deep within my soul
Through your dreams
You hold in your hands
Bring it down
Why am I here?
Talking to some mouth
Here to stay
True truth
These haute bourgeois days
Fill up and rattle
Soon the thought has gone
Live and die like kings
Pretty cool
It's a good place
Feel free to grow from me
Lost time watching rain on television
First name from the tomb
Dark rain
Young men just like me
All the people’s dishes
Warning
Are you afraid?
We care not who dies
Never seen the glory
Lord of paint
The freedom
He looked like a picture
One of their own to follow
I don’t want your memory
Most of the time I’ll be lying
I feel kinda bad because I didn't
No other time
I can tell you how to kiss her
Like underwater
All signs are for a bad change
Over there
In the midst of suffering
Finally, you look here
The quality made him weary
Love all the feelings
Tears began to flow
Rekindled memories
Your life for your day
Set me free
Ready for a wave
I still can’t seem to look at it
Should I please say it?
Pretending nothing
Drink what you can
Back to square one
We are his own rules
Waiting for them
She’s still spinning
Need to try again
The way to check somebody's dream
The pearls of a glade
Oh my god; I know you and I live by fate
And the fear’s gone
Snakes sing and crawl into them
Playing for a laugh
Stay home
The lights are flashing
Freaks don't understand
Down with sadness
A man that can’t understand
Fierce from the mouth
All man-made crime
No one around
Feel yourself in the future
A riot with ghosts
Watch my heart turn
Damaged memories
Took everything from you
Sculpted for profit
Out of the blue
A bank vault of all his friends
Got little toys
While I’m flying
In the ten-cent battle
He’s a blank slate
I want you
Into the dark
Do you care?
Nothing really can be said
Promise me greatness
Let's get going
Love, love, love
Deep inside
The angry pirate stares
Trying to salvage something
See you tonight
Whispering canyons
Please wait before you cry
A silver star
But you can fly by your side
Just hide your hands
Hear me shout
Paying off friends
When it ain't white
Still looking at this empty place
You want to be free
Go drown on the face
No one’s talked about her
Walking on water
Deaf heartsets
The search for sleep
Chasing and beating
I was going to hell
Stars on fire
Fly a thousand miles
Lies that you’ve put in your mind
The line is strong
Night through your tears
Beat their minds from the inside
If the spirits of the dying could stand at my feet
No brainer
Beyond a thousand jagged walls
You're upset, we can just sit here and weep
Bring your eyes close
Drop it and pass it
Yeah but there is no escape
Take the butter out
Don't feel bad about it
Pushing through his mind
Through the crack of a feather
Night light under the silver light
Let us know
You’re buried in sorrow
Stars rise, fall
We move past that unspoken tension
Fresh juice
That ill fated for them
Now find me
Find time
Say the love that I feel
But all I see is yellow
Saying: That their time
Close my eyes
I need you
Some people crawl down on to you
Through our wild angles
Touching you like some emotion
Rip their muscles
They must've gone really high
Attracts your attention
A heartbeat unravelling
Bring out the dustweavers
Nobody's listening
That’s why
Take it out of your face
Sitting still and staring
Who?
To grow up so young
The angel of light
King of the dance floors
Lights for me
New flag
I’m scared I’m gonna see
Between the streets
A jet black stall
Till you be called
Hold your tongue
Saw the dawn in the cemetery
Something that I don't know
Go ahead and drop me
Where the money was yesterday
If it takes you some more time
Waiting to meet you
My vision’s starting to fade
I’m pretty
May take my heart
Sounds strange
I hear you talk
Don’t wanna try
Learn to treat the girl
Trying to catch a flight
Just staying awake
Tears of hope
Just mine
You’ve got nothing
What was the pain?
Examine you
Run past her
Point at you
Love and whatever you do
Perfect for dealing with today
Seen the way
Now I know
Some girl dreams
You don’t know it’s this way
The stars shake
Wonder the nation
A joke
The people still call you names
Tomorrow we wake
Bounced in pain
I’ll never find love
Doesn't really work yet
It will make you think
I'm free
A sweet warm rainbow
I feel... my love
Oh nothing is ever cracked
On fire
You know I’ve seen the same patterns
Till tomorrow it must grow
Just a thought
Cutting through haze
Your roots got buried
For the dead wailing
We can sing
I make mistakes
If they’re looking forward
You will do so
With what is left
Spattered an amber sky
Third window
Fly all over the city
You know I’m getting up
Damages of record
Cause it’s okay
Clear love for ourselves
Here comes healing
You did it by force
This game - meaning so much to me
Tell me my story
Pimp my words
Got a face full of shit
For every bar you dance
So now we belong here
You're all alone
Throwing stuff away
My love is in the clothes
Across the corner
Where he said salvation comes out
You’ve seen me walk my highroad
Search through every corner
The footsteps are wide
He said no
Fire and anger
Roar on the floor
She never talks about me
The womb of a gentleman
Making love again
Some show
In his anger
Different sorts of dreams
You’re not even strong
Inspiration in the sky
Now come to finish
Got hit
Let it down
You’re going to stay here forever
I cannot believe this
Modern telephone
A fine hill
Beautiful to see
Like drinking water
But this is its own story
We all came down blind
That immortal song
Love and show me that
If it’s Sunday morning
I had to know
Either move or die
And he’ll be waiting
Rave
That’s not our fault
Taking on things
Who’s really the king
Just for fun
Only pictures given
From: Young Voices
Freedom’s only opportunity
Down under the land of hollies
Lying in your nightmare
Five to one
A beautiful red earth
Waiting to wake
This old art: You’re always so interesting
He’s getting one of them
Green here, yellow there
For just a moment
Made to sound rock'n'roll
But you’ll find me in the world
Bloodline is broken
I'm coming home
And yet I’m growing tired
Whenever they say I'm wrong
I'm so sorry
Much darker tomorrow
A proud rhyme
Stranger goes by my direction
While you are looking down
Across the town
He sure looks like a hospital-girl
And I wasn't there at the wedding
Sunlit from my soul
You just can’t help it
You can take it on
It is called earth
It’s a pretty girl in a dirty hotel
It came out his skin and talked to me
Where old men came from
That movie
The dry muscle
I’m the wrong one
With all our bullets
In the gate
Don’t feel like dying
Just walk around
Better play dead
Found something that interests me
Changes what we know
Where I stay
Can't face you
Rather be here
Down by law
Put a door open
Laughing at the static
A key to getting things done
Send off in the order of time
The evils we fear
Great beyond your being
Enough the golden harp
Turn me back
The smell of hypocrisy
Bloodstained angel hair
Looking over you
Please stare at me
And I fell for you
I don't know why you are here
Pictures of them falling apart
A white chicken
Born to wander
No matter what happens
Slow motion
Looking over your shoulder
Quiet my silence
It took me from living out with my mind
My tracksuit
The number of dinosaurs on an island
The quiet that fills my body
The streets weeps
Feeling sad
Her boss is like a snake
Set you free
One hundred pages of notes
A girl and a girl
Take off my clothes
A way of life
Sailing high through the silent sky
Catch yourself in your mind
Going crazy
A human made of spirit
You see it from time to time
You must be single
A newborn son
In your mind
And some more than others
Turning down from a mission
Lost in you
You’re so free
A pair of blonde ladies
And I’ve no idea
You go down my broken path
Rise of the king
You know how to make my heart sing
Put you in the wrong place
No one had any clue
Turn the rainbows down
My daughter
Your love is eternal
In the interest of full harmony
It never leaves me
Made me feel
Freedom no matter what we do
Welcome to the crazy lands
Good morning
You’ll know no more
Poured up him
Leave them cold
Spread the love
Rock through the air
This record is such a charm
Doesn't get much worse
Precious pieces of lace
The prettiest life you've ever seen
There were horns on a stick
Finds room for her evil laughter
Clear my mind
Smelling water
Just as she will talk
Wouldn't you like a lil' light
Spinning my wings
Time to grow stronger
Pretty sweet place
Goes on my mind
All of my free time
It was only natural
Know the only way you know
Split time and bring her back
And one of my violent rules
Grandfathered to the gang
Leave the light on
As cool as he was
I don't know why
I hate having to be alone
Shiver in my song
Love is made on the ground
Give me time
Crossing the waters
The secret sauce
Morning clouds
All of them outside
To drag yourself away
You’ll find me in a restaurant
Giving you no love
Very nice example
Act like the newborn
Let your pet
Here he comes
Work up tonight
To be quiet
Hold it and watch it flow
Burning inside
A dark heart
Will do anything
Looking at the records
Time gives me hope
The watchman
Full of nonsense
Then what do you think
My heart is right
But I'm not getting along
My brother died down
And set to dance
Hurt his emotion
The need for a righteous dream
I know now
It keeps your hot lips from looking wild
Trying to waltz out
You’re bringing a night in her head
Time to go
Sick with a cold
Throwing away excuses
You will be master of my mind
They understand
Both of you
He’s smart too
Dust your shit down
The head of a cow
Some shady eyes
The sight that comes around the bend
I’m a boy
Give me some beer
Who’s all you need
Smoke falls from her eyes
You made me laugh
Tell me the root of all evil
Something's known
The reason I’m here
Every wound dies
Of the mouth of my sorrow
Embrace kindness
To spare my son
So you’re really doing right
And I’ll have you know
Tears apart
All the pictures
For miles along the highway
Imagine my eyes
Lost them all
Loving and trying to teach
I didn't want to say anything
Getting married right away
On the shore
When I ran away from them
Young Mary is half asleep
Searching for a promise
You’re the future
Crying too loud
That ship walked through the moon
Things we could do
Heavy armor
A butterfly in your hand
Your life is meant to be pretty
A constant stream of lies
Ask a piece of your mind
Walk around
I know it’s you
Miss your words
What she called my portrait
I can’t be shy
The moons in your eyes
Third time around
Until you are ready
Is it okay if it just keeps saying so?
First he saw me
And don’t give up
To guide you
Unfailing
Feeling like you only know
You’re my man
Hot lips
A real bandit boy
Cracking out the first wave
He’s a shark
Man, tell me your way
Underneath your despair
Chasing into fire
And I see it clearly
Letting fly
My overworked mother
Over the bottom of my depth
What now?
I will be forever
Underneath the creeper boats
Looking for something to say
Ain't gonna be unkind to you
She asked you if she wanted a dream
A goal-maker
And then the silhouette
To see the world in a lather
I can’t understand why
You’re making so much noise
Hear me scream
To some leitmotif
Reaching from the ashes
My vision is fucked
It’s hard to name
You’re a voice
No more emotions
A cage window
Returned all of our glory
You've got me there
Scared for a minute
He's got your eyes on him
Passed within sight
So you talk about love, conversation, and money
For some reason
It feels like a dream
I may make you feel bad
To listen to you
You’re all I need
Let’s finish now
Play it off in space
Some guardsmen to run
Right now I see him
Things that didn't belong
How much I hate you
Every day
Breaking your strength
Fly with red coat
Down as an addict
Gold in the evening
Flashing through a distorted mind
Change an attitude
Eyes in the hills
Move the target
These pants do not fit
Your holy name
Entitled
For all eternity
Through the gutters
There are times I thought I was gone
Talking to strangers
Reading here
Don’t stare at you
Waiting for the sun
Time to be good
In the book
Here is my friend
It’s one of the biggest lies
I believe that for some reason
I’m lonely
Sunshine, sunshine
Fumbling through sentences
Life is fine
I've got something
Mind hardens by being awake
For once
Above the stations
Blue earth
Let's see what comes
Living on the edge
Crying all night
Wanting to play
And there is truth in my heart
This language
Would you like to dance to it
My head takes over
Sick of me
The reason I exist
We'll take care of each other
Dirty dishes
One of the only great artists
Back for the night
You ain’t there to hide
Rides his past
Locked into your mouth
My greatest sensation
You’ve seen your reflection
It wasn't a dream
Go back home
Come and show
Everyone's dying
Love hearts fill their temples
To get away from our parents
Meet the Queen
Ride off into space
This is all I have, play with me
We will make them go away
Got a true love album
Nothing could have made me scream
I don't like them
Put your brain in your pocket
Ain’t like the world’s a city
Feel it in my eyes
For a month there is weeping
Nothing’s left to show
How it’s done
Darkness in the night
Heart bleeds
Lest we keep flying through the sky
Burn the hole
The Lord is watching
Ours, my only refuge
Love for life
A position held dear to her heart
While the sun's not shining
In the middle of the desert
I can't take it anymore
Lost innocence
Give me your love
I know it’s evening
When you see me
A rose-tinted-glass
There's no room for you
That falls apart
Singing under the moon
Don’t have faith
I wanna show you how
Chasing the brightness
A-changin' like all these people
We feel good
And I don't know what
That game's been on forever
These songs give my generation space
Over the road
First things first
What’s wrong
Best of all worlds
Thoughts, no matter what
Halt the world
Slip on my honey collar
So in your mind
Unfolding the leads
Stand in line
To sit with a statue
And what is darkness until the last scene
The bus comes to go
Dust-filled town
I am sorry, I need to get away
Still asking me if I was meant
Easy
War to slow down
You saw me just standing there
Enough pain in your bones
Made out really lousy
Ready to burn my house
We need you more
I can’t play jagged walls
Only one brainless goon
Golden
How I ride
I just can't seem to get away
Fucking hangover
Make me believe
Never gotta be together
People play hard if they can
Shadows on an airplane
I feel myself falling apart
Hiding
By the age of forty-five
Memories of your children
Accept this door
Love is your own laws
Inside locked out
Turned to steam
My place of pleasure
When did you reach so high?
Morning mornin', barbed wire
Used up the patience
Tell my future lovers
Trapped, dead, trapped
In his rage
Won’t they please you?
In darkness
Real life
You get close to heaven
You’re dead
I’ve met you
The one that started it all
Your heart is singing
Everybody feels down
Keep their heart from me
While you lie awake
All new toys
The truth
Hang on!
Guilt won’t help you
Climbing the tree
Won’t hold in your arms
Fucking say what?
Like time for the wind
Took the girl away
She’s lived the dream
And my body is sinking
Those who lie
Alone on our honeymoon
The roots in the sand
Open a gun
Recruit your friends
Out at night
I never know
For all our deep grief
Battering glass
Things you see and hear everyday
Left my back to the ground
Everything is in place
He's inside me
Standing next to a friend
We are parted lips
Little startling
Sign me to see that a dark tune
One day she’ll smile
People talking and laughing
It’s beautiful
Cause nothing can be done
Flying past home
Gonna make us laugh
And let me know
Lying for a while
Don’t forget me
Followed by the others
I was of glass
Heavy pressure
Caught up in a misunderstanding
And you don’t take my word for it
Under this curse
A crown
I’ll keep shooting
To see his shit right now
Look around
Im with you
Take out your mind
Looking for the anchor
At home
But I won't see you again
From the ocean floor
What they say
Did you watch pornstars when you were young?
Very funny
Working without thought
Where none stood
Alright first time's the charm
Bitter as ice
One shirt
It was off to the races
Take care of yourself
Cold blooded secrets
See that this is true
She’s flying out
A flaming shark
I will never stop
When he pulls through
Like back in his days
Iron on the silver line
Let's not waste any time
Fucking stare at me
To play games of dying
Bring home the star
Many birds over again
Strung between wheels
Hang your hands together
Sold!
I’m not crazy
When you become satisfied
Let you become satisfied
About fourteen or eighteen feet away
This thing we call beauty
You have no tomorrow
More of a drain
How long will it take?
Made it feel great
She may be empty
See you all around
We’re torn apart
Need to understand
A lie
Underserved visions
Can’t pay attention
We die singing in his breast
Raise the wind
Just a regular guy
I saw it for weeks
Mumble with the teeth of Satan
The urge against kings
Third down on the scale
We just sold out
Is the thing without you here?
You’ll have it yours
In my shoes
My head in the air
Crude free unmade
He’ll know what you know
He threw it on me
I’m just getting more
Accept your place
For some I could hold
Crucify it
Your blood will beat me
To run so fast
Sinking
Sweatshop brushes
Your fame and your troubles
That it’s a matter of time
All the better for it
As the devil
Lines blurred
On the spine
Streets of yours
Screwing someone?
A beautiful night
Overkill
Ain't there nothing wrong with me?
Nude flies
You wanna dance naked?
We don’t see it’s long ago
Many a lost look
Spending as a millionaire
Slices and pickles
How is my day
Re-title: When’s that band playing?
We all die
Then I was young again
Dead bird
She wore down her ties
Another day with the crime
Could be you’re madder than hate
I never did it right
Confessions
Let’s say okay
Don’t bother until the present day
It’s fine
No one is afraid
Caught as a shadow
And if it all ends on the same day
They're supposed to be like an ordinary day
And I wonder how
Bring my duties to you
I never thought of it so
Some time to buy change
Run away
And I
Glowing mist
Hey go away
Rumbling in the water
Your thoughts belong within me
Let him be king
Everything she had before
I just came for you
People flatter
Blows your drink
I'm still afraid
Dibbing my heart
Where still you come
Acrobat made me awake
Walking like a lost soul
Me alone
Do you think you will ever come?
Beyond on the daily stream
I can see it now
Time is running out
Baby, it won't come again
Breaking your pride
But they don’t want to know
Death of a gentleman
Unapologetically helpful
With purpose
Don't call me jealous
Here at your place
No room for error
We always knew he was gonna die
Imagine the shock
High on the mountain
I’m tired of this threesome
I took your sword
Not a side-by-side draw
Let the pain escape
Shake and weep
Jump backwards - I see you’re so beautiful
Put in my crown
Run to your room
Brash and insecure
She's alright
Waiting for the sky to warm
Rudely
Something so small
Too low for fame
If you get sick of me
To sit and watch her life change
And the double life’s in conflict
Since the dawn
This is your pride
Let's just get a fancy little gig
Straight to the nuclear force
The final boss
Swing by the scenes
Born of a thousand bombs
Hold your breath
Looking for something new
The only man outside
Say something exciting to people
Goodbye really good
Googly
As soon as I can feel her today
One of the finest cities of the world
Sold me so much
Don't force you
Mind uself
Take care of your emptiness
As a reflection
Next time I can look
Broken souls
My mama
Flows from your head
Here she is
Don't touch it
Yeah, what’s the point?
Just to try and keep the honeymoon quiet
Someone gets killed
To try and hang ourselves
Do something
Evil control freak
Sign me up on Good Friday
Some ancient men
You’re feeling so ugly
I'll understand
Only to dream
Lay claim to fame
First and only dreams
Got no time to lose
Blown away
Steal the feel of your time
Yeah I saw it in the flag
No deal
We ought to be together
The way to soul
The snow moving
We're all heading up for one day
New timezone
Drown the palette
Just a passing topper
Milk on the ocean floor
I find love
He's not afraid
In a room with a bar
The cake
All the speed making this show reel
Walking with my hands
Fading through dreams
Love hurts
Maybe I'm not quite at the right place
Just taking some time to look
My fucking face
A bad kiss
It's all you
Take a comfort
I’ll give you peace
He sits in awe
Inside I fear
Rushing up the salt highway
Lies my mind
Just moving in
Pleasures inside
Tears off my skin
Want to know, how you got where?
I don’t need you
Waiting for you to come
The dreams in the dead silence
But you’re my girl
Drifting mind
Specially shining eyes
Dream about going down
You’re watching me
Too late to say goodbye
Do you need me now?
The day is over
I’m fucking alone
Keep away from your friends
Let's kick your ass
A warm wall
Your golden age
As long as I’ve been asleep
Lonely face
That's all I was gonna say
Your smile clearly set ablaze
Sitting across from somebody
Move up to me
She’s lying
Where the dreams were from
I'll go to the bathroom
Everything good you are right now
Colors fade
Tears starting to come out
Feel like the ant, someone said
Don’t mind me
To be in love
Nose to roof
We have never met
Enablers
Swear to a girl
You’ve got to go home
I’m the devil
Leave her out of reach
We can't ride you away
The end game
You made my soup
Living this life
This town called you
For making our call
No speech today
The fabled hero
Try this together
No words for a part of me
To win up all that you missed
You get this’s a secret
Wake up now
A weird crowd
The world of music
Can I feel your heart beating
Into the lonely water
It shouldn't be so much like that
Nobody was supposed to catch me
Turned out like this
The groans
We’ll ride
Rather at ease
The only game in town
When it comes to boobs
Sixty shades
Sell the dishes
To ride it in one
Time is at a standstill
I’m still scared
A fleeting scene
Revolution that kills all mankind
Never the deviant dream
I’m looking to move tomorrow
You’re always there
Say please: Bringing me down
She finally did
Fly in this green cloud
Stop keeping it in suspense
Depends on your timing
The way you talk
My hand
Evil in your eyes
Marching to see stars
If he ever flew
He always had a spare change
Killing the kindness
The waters call
Just another roof
Go for the highroad
I can’t tell what to say
I’m almost awake
Green waves
Down the ages
That crazy memory
Been through their yarmulkes
Grow up to become a complete man
Among the stars
The corpse becomes new
Just to wake us up
You can probably beat me
Right, I could only go in
My stay
Inherited by fate
Asleep in a chair
Don’t be afraid
Back on the run
I can barely move
Bring me freedom
More energy
Some man's side of the life
Confused, desperate
Time for the sun
Sculpture
Really just a boring ball of fire
I lost my sight
One morning
First come, first served
Sail my lonely spirit
You know, you’re good
I’ll never stay, forever
In time
First of all
Better off playing our game
You won’t make it through
A butterfly
Or destroyed
Keep the power fresh
I love you like I love myself
How soon will they fade
In your blood now
Visions of his fingers
Hark up a while ago
Silver bullet
Say hello to everybody
Turn your song around
No search to hide
Going to follow me around
Why don't you pay the bill?
It’s nice to be around you
The legendary lion
Take your strange girl pose
In your youth
Barely fitting my soul
To leave you running
Gave it my all
Who’d you meet?
Today it was dark
Different numbers
Reaching out
Surrender up here
Long on room service
Oh, it's amazing
Climb a wall
This heavenly god
Above a big cell
He put the special stains on his arm
Talk to your father
Buses in the sky
Do you know how to take it from me
The dragon will soon descend
Where there are long forgotten rooms
Scrubbed the paint
I cannot be seen
Suddenly gone
Catch your hand
Poetry
That will be me all the time
And then I was like, What are you doing?
A rabbit?
He pushed a woman
Hear the sounds
Burn my mind
Sitting on his shoulder
Make me forget
Somebody you can go home to
You’re not standing down
Take a line
New world order
Checking down
To keep my memory away
You made it to prison
The emptiness inside me
Lord of rage
What do I know’s happening
How you’ll find my home
Just known
Explain that you are everywhere
Good looking and beautiful
In this sandpit place
If only you could see
What is wrong with me
Pray for my babe
To get you through
Homeward
Gangway out of control
My sister and I
She can hurt no more
You’re so beautiful
Way to understand
Running for each other
Born to be treated
A new kingdom
A month separates us
A photo of little Lily
Hanging in the bushes
On the street
I knew
What feeling like contact means
See all my dreams come true
Sweet kids
Whose eternal dreams
I kept going up
A thousand years of land
We will never meet
I think you don’t belong here
Music died out of heaven
You know what you think
Things I thought of no one else
All in one neat lil' jet
Made of powder
Till I end
I can feel it stalking behind me
Never wear down
Perfect
In the midst of her glory
Chasing this high name
You’re a nuisance
And said, it wouldn't hurt to be free
A girl I would never lose
What's your boss supposed to say?
That new collar
And with no holy flag
The bargain is overtaken
Such an ugly hand
You’ve only been asleep for two days
With a question mark
What do you want?
In the heart of the city
Straight from the clanging cages
Haunting me
Without searching
Crying against time
Waves back down again
Green light
I'm getting tired
People on the inside
Fire within the span of time
Round hand to sell
Your soul
A thousand ugly people
Can come next time
It was a pain to bear
What would you do?
Got past it
Using as a weapon
You know what you say
You’ll be my friend
Mouth opening
We live in a picture
Take control
We’re like pirates
Through her nose
It’s not worth it
The season is on
Don't make me cry
A garden cut leaves a dead star
Never going to wake up
Pass down a clue
Some of you will have to ask me
Looking for a good night
I had been living
Darkest journey
I must make her feel good
A rich, noble face
Drink nothing but bleach
Then somehow I’ll find it
Hideaway
You are me
Up above the cloud
She threw off the kart
The way you dress
Instead of breaking, beat, bend
Please don’t touch
In the shadow of the ring
Underneath every shattered lock
Your invincible old self
No less
This is the damn place
(Can see my reflection)
I still got it
So now you're right
And it got darker
What you’ve got left
Every gun
There was one gentle light
God is gonna find me
Crying pills
But don’t let you at all
Talking dirty, winking at me
No sound in my heart
Take me to my palace
My sky
Walking around like the darkness
Some new dreams
My path came undone
Diner at the devil's table
Different son of a bitch
Down to our feet
Time to go the way you are
I’m never going nowhere
Watch me singing
Turn down my music
You are’re the top monster
I can lay back
The other day
You're fucking my soul
All I want to say is new stars
To find out where he came from
Brain me hard
Oh, I know all of this
Just the gate
Got a vision
Going for it
Put my hand in your mouth
Make those sounds just a little further away
This is my little world
Made to move
Nothing you can afford
Getting nowhere’s all they want
Give you no opportunity
When it comes down to what I know
So he gets paid now
Get on my wife
How could you know?
Candyman’s face
Blood for me
Shoulda used me
What is the big deal?
Her parents flew around
Fireball
Some time, close enough
Rocking my wheels
Something that is still soul
With bones to kill
You can smell her hair
A very minor obstacle
Back home, there
I'll stay a while longer
Vanquish the cold
Tells me where you went
Under God's authority
Be free to ride
Feed the king
Hoping to die
Cover
A club
Silver hair
Seeing her again
Try to see him a while in the haze
Take my word for it
Walking the streets
Midnight dawn
Grow some bodies
Climb the ladder
Yes, bring me no pain
Open mouth
I never took that road
To the eyes of his own people
Too weird to say goodbye
Down at the beach
Killing me
Walking across the stage
Since I found it in you
Such a shame
The voice in your head
Some little little note
Huddled before the fire
The thrill of moving across the water
Time won't run out
It's easier to be a light
Everybody knows, dance to a tune
Can’t seem to change
Stabbed in the ground
One line of code
These are your dreams
I need somebody to love
Going to die
You’ve got to feed me my nuts
Why do you need me?
Depends on how you feel
Nothing you could see
You’ve gotta be tired
O Brother to you
I’m going to live like nobody knows
Don’t mind me, come on
Hands on walls
It was like I had been shooting
A bunch of old songs
Stiff walls
You keep walking
Can't cry
I’m really, really tired
I got a gourd
The stars are shining
My name is still your name
My mind is loaded
Took no break
Celebrate our King
You’re so calm
Couldn't survive the warning
The shadow of love
Bloodstains to our memory
You know my title
Will you join us tomorrow
Every dream comes true
About her
Let us follow
Don’t you want me?
Goze right through my shit
Let’s stop it
You are exactly where I ought to be
Burn down doors
Passed by wind blows
Too early
Very scary
Gather the truth
The dream you dream about
It’s illegal
If it’s a miracle
The seams were drawn together
Me under the century
I am strong
Enclosing doors
The fifth time around
How lovely you can be
Who wouldn’t play me?
Everyone listens
Iron hand now
To find true love
Now come on down
Panic, new and fresh
I’ve been one for a long time
Last fall
Smells too good to be true
Paying off these nightmaskers
Are you crazy?
Her image comes on slowly
In ruins
You’re not the only one to love
We can call you saint
Your high is my high
Died in a pit of infamy
Like a mistress
Uncharacteristic success
You see?
Waterfalls
My caretaker
Take away my affection
Anything you might say
Fortunate to have won
New York City
Out in the open
All the little angels in yellow
I say you don't show
You’ll never understand
To cry out
If we used her
In her stormy New York days
The sun
You’re feeling so bad
Things to do
Please hold down my key
Your father and his money
Return to our lives
What ends up in your eyes
Caught in a trap
You let him stay with you
That smile’s in your eyes
For three days old
You still want to sing
On a summer morning
Not for real
A gilded story
Turned down yesterday
Your hand with him
My mask of a fiery soul
Happy tomorrow
Never sleepwalk
Your ghost can’t see
Your old life
Stealing street music
The only ones to die
You started walking right there
The sunrises
Tell your lover that
Makes you so happy
But it was the first time we all talked
Restlessness is what keeps men from earning
Tomorrow’s getting better
He’s already been awake in another dream
Poor soul
One of you’s just a chance
You stay the night
To face the evil of the act
Like running across the skyline
In my head
Call me home
I want something from you
Fly again
Kissing every last one
A crime against good law
Somewhere out there
Lead by a light
In the fog
Waiting for night
Before he’s gone
Taking up nothing
We had seen my sides
Flying a balloon
Forget everything
I take all of my notes
With a gaze of pity
I’ll be cool
I’ll never meet you
Had no windows
This girl’s from Maine
We don't love you
Our dreams come true
Love always rest
He never said goodbye
Ripping through the earth
Let them call me weary
Streets of city
Like no other
Curse, bury, come down on stage
Now she deserves it
My place
The trees are falling
Strangleholds my memories
This is a day for dialogue
I will keep you
Distractions
Join with me
I am your spirit
Out of the forest
All over your body
Begin to sleep
His feet are getting stashed away
I took pity from you
Eyes of ravens
He'll know you’re wrong
Know how things are from now on
The filthy double
Day after day
A sad time
Sleeping you away
Rock for a reason
With a companion in tow
You’ve only got one problem
Your skin is alive
The angels say the world is never to end
I like it cold
Try getting away
A ghost town
Each song
How I see you
Do the right thing
My place in history
Money won't dance
A sucker who knows nothing
Hello everyone
Yeah, I guess
I've seen no reason to think
Someone saved your life
No real revolution
On the calm shore
One bad mime
It’s a cliché
Time passes and the sun shines
With the good plan
If the mice still live inside
Tears of sorrow
Good girl
Unknown
A promise of some value
Life or death
Brought me all the stress
There were no waste of their money
Instinctive devotions
I’m fine with it
Make no mistake
Broke the bridge
Be careful for the kings of emptiness
They mumble more than it’s worth
This full stop
It’s nice to be around
Sorry it gets cold soon
Smells like a pair of wings
The highest worth leaving behind
Sweet leaves of glory
You’ll meet your future
You have to have empathy
The door opens in the late summer
Head over heels
I know what you mean
When we get down on our hands
We reach across and around you
You’ll never get there
Move this thing
That same spirit
And he’s bearing the bullshit
Hand laid
I see you’re a wise man
Their wives talked
Made love to the devil
Visions of ruin
Love reminds me
Somewhere off in the distance
We can't go nowhere
Throw away the secrets
Gimme candy
Lookin' for somebody else
Nothing earthly
You had never done him a favour
When it comes out
From inside out
Wear it all over your clothes
Kiss in my mouth
You say it's down to your bones
And as the sun shines
Here you go again
I don’t understand why you’re dying
I’m going to give you a crack
Something along the lines
What is the beauty of yours?
Flying low
Sing the music
Took you by surprise
Silent from the eyes
But I’m going to fly
Whenever I walk on shore
Spent one of the days in solitary
With devotion’s eyes
I will serve you
Through the smoke from the fire
Down at the truth
A salute to the love-specialty
The old man’s side of the story
This cauldron full of secrets
He cut inside
I could feel you all around me
Losing him
Blue gills
Singed with this reason
We need to get home
A demure and sweet feeling
Wilder than I remembered
The grass might be turning
Understanding everything
No new baby name
Makes your bed empty
Where you belong
The mayor
Going into war
I was one time
I will pass this point
Reassure
Higher in my price
She’s like an idiot
Sweet and kind and caring
Gotta send her home
You don’t go all summer long
Speak soon
A sensitive song
The sunset
No, no, no
Twelve years I've walked the streets
I feel like nobody knows
But, won't you know that I gave you this?
His body appears so immovable
And who knew?
I’ll put you on your ass
It’s a merry dance
Your senseless laughter
Why I hate you
With no voice I’m gonna go
Saw the full moon
Find something of value
The pretty way
It ain't hard enough
Time away, Romeo and Juliet
I wonder what?
Your blue
Down with all my passions
No sense going on now
Her hair is thicker and rich red
Restless by memory
You’re a beautiful girl
Cryin'
You’ve seen it all
Never spoke that I knew
Long live the innocent
Fucking send me home
The living room
We lived in the moment
During the month before Christmas
When the rope fell apart
Asleep
If only you had died
To turn me away
Happy, satisfied, bliss
You don’t have to say it today
I love making mistakes
Foreskin simpletons
No time to cry
Release more confidence
A dying star
God offered herself to me
So tender and cool
Through a goddamned window
He turned my bedroom into a casino
Stranger voices appear
Tomorrow will be changing
Warmaster, warlord
Stripes are for men
With the promise of tomorrow
I didn’t know what I was doing
Talking instead of doing
The thin line
As you wake
Lies in an alley
What I once thought to be a beautiful art
On that side of the coin
A tear in his eye
Night after day
He put it away
Where the sun shines
Look where I could fly
Evil feeling
Accepting the things you're good at
Let me reach for you
Put our loyalty aside
The one who knew right?
One that loves to know
A dream of serenity
Everything in your hands
We should go
You had it all figured out
See the terrible realities
Deadbeat into a frenzy
Naughty, sweet girl
Cast me as your foreign enemy
A part of you
The blackest corridors
Take a fresh start
One thing to remember
You took it away
Working just to hold it together
You’ll need me
Disagree with my opinions
That I like to believe
And now it’s over
Tell the ghost story
These days I can’t find you
A difference between rose
Love of pain
No other way to go
The king’s wife
You’re my lover
Forget your devotion
Don’t laugh
Anything you could say
A brave, jealous, violent blind angel
I saw my mother
A fine trinity
They took my life, they took my money
Longtime commitment
Hooking on the stars
Cast the same pattern as we did
Because I will be fine
And bring about violence
Join me tonight
It was so true
I’ve never seen anything like it
A desperate dream
The palms down
Can anyone relate
Starlight
What makes my nights different
It’s just plain terrible
The way
An unspoken legacy
Only you’re here
Here in a world full of shadows
Please push a button
I ’m not afraid to die
Stupidity waits without warning
A nice job
Don’t be king
Streetwise swindlers
Act matter
Dreams too extreme
It's slow for you
A look back at my childhood
I’m scared
Is it okay to be where you are
Poppies sitting here
If you can never get lost
Do what you must
The romance
I’m blind
The tree of the free state
Split lips
It had come with it
Won't nobody go
Drinking rainbows
And you can hear it now
Just get me through this one
That fire in the sun
And the future of my existence
Busted from all my dreams
You’ll love me
A gentle wind
Today I’ve had that fear
I’m locked up
It's over now
Won't know what you need
You seem surprised
When all comes crashing down
The fame pleases us
I’m about to set down
Silently remembered
She wanted him
Over the rough ocean
You take the spiritual home
Just a friendly lie
Selling every penny
Here is the vision
Waking up
Fucking rotten water
How I'm looking for glory
Because of your glory
Your daily responsibilities
Walking in the black
Let the golden age begin
To be lazy
Have a soul
Looking out for you
Very soon will we let the stars start to fade
Standing in line with the law
I won’t take credit
I’ll pray for your soft affections
You’ll go, you and me
Lord of years
Come on pupils
All men will be sailors
Not done
Sweeps your skin
Walls across time
Vanishing my mind
Stand against me
We had a beer when it came time
This is a good time
Screeching and walking to the end
Take the rainbow
Sit down next to your friend
You’re so the big test
Love me a bit
We found the same news
What do you mean by it?
Explain it to me
Throwing me into a mirror
But it’s so damn hard
Buried in the trees
Wish I could take it easy
Talk of running away
Your life is a mystery
Lord No
Waiting for your song
To be sad and angry
That's what dreams are made of
The best things
This sound it made
Such as she’s been taught to watch
That I look like a phoenix
It is such a waste of time
Fly him along
For the better too
My feet were beating up
The same broken promises
Just out of habit
Let's keep ourselves apart
Let's have your movies
I’ve got no match
You've got your ears wide open
Never seemed like the time for this conversation
I had to take care of my business
Tackling this dilemma
The rich kid
Any, do you mean, anything?
Begging
Your rages from under the tent
Never let someone else touch you
Jump on our heels
A policeman walkin' by at the tender age
A ring over your face
A kiss in the desert
Smoking on the beach
It could be a vice
How could I be dead here?
We walk through a dream
You’re being pigheaded
And they believe
Spending time crying
He might look fine and soft
Riding on the sand
All these lights parted
Strung with dread
While there’s violence
This tired show
Pay it forward
He died like you all day
That sad you
Never mind me
Like drowning in the street
You’ve got a fire in your brain
She's stuck to one side
The only place I knew
Silver standard
Say something nice
Hide your soul
Makes me so stupid
Voices you can hear
Ready to dance
Knock it dead
Crashing through the night
As they say, the shortening of memory
All your dreams do
Rockin' your cell phones
Letting your powers slip
But beware all the evils
Good at things
And because of the way you look?
Sweet dreams would scream
Put the needle in your ear
I owe you nothing
Rock calls
Betrayal a bad son
You fought through some stupid game
But instead we all look down on you
Somewhere a strange peace
I’ll go in my father's shadow
To hide yourself
Throw the false grin
Cry all right
Those feet are burned
Burning flames in the sky
That’s what you'd be
Into silence
Oh, come on soon
He’s fighting back
Don’t forget it
You’re wearing face
Dreams are broken
Just want to help
And he’s the king
Everybody else’s home
An old friend
The basement seems cold
Can't stay in our place
You’ve got a feeling
Do you think I am wrong
Why you’re off to a great start
One can’t help you
My starting point
Hello universe
Stupid mama
Run you through
You know what I'm afraid
While they are here
Why if she shouldn't go
Don’t mind if I remain
Dirty trick king
Coming here’s nothing but pride
Made out
No longer belong
Match your mind
Black slips and silver wires
You’ve never met me
Be prepared for the attack
Catch up
But life's a trap
Who's in the box
My love’s gone from my heart
Oh my love, this means so much to me
First I spent my life pursuing a mystery
One driver so much
Right off the razor wire
Good things never happen
The quick time and once again
The glow of his appearance
Since she'll take you away
I’m sorry for every little thing
You never know
Then she opens the box and it’s busy
Living in a lonely place
Trapped in a fire
What about you
Where do you want to go
In this windy time
Every day I am awake
Many of the times the truth hangs
Look at my feet
Feeling too quiet
A small rainbow
Just how a world will end
The wooden shack
I met his father
That doesn't sound too good
How long will you hold on to my love
Always
Dancing from the roof
The machines won’t seem so complicated
You’re a giant strap
Let us hide in our halls
That won't work
Drop the worst of your silly ways
Stairway
My eyes turn red
I can’t control what I see
Where the pain is now
Made to fight to make it so
Freaks from outer space
Walking as fuck
Did you know?
Lips of war
Comin' together
Amusing the imagination
On the prowl for you
Put a little evil into our lives
Your soul is insensible
Lights down now
Like an idol
The one with no candle burning
Spinning in the desert
Im tired of staying where I am
With her eyes
I took out my mitts
This funeral is just before me
You’ve been shot
One of the kings
I got to come with you
Those first snowflakes
This little square
You have been made fun of
All this time
Should have been warning
Standing amongst yourselves
And how cool it is
A red flag you won't see
Dumb music
He became sick once again
Little idol
True and a ghost
I never spoke to you
Time no longer the worst
She’s still inside me
Everybody says
We've got a deal
Blue and white
What do we do now
Always changing
Touch me
I'm home tonight
Oh, the sense of wonder
Of what?
Keep his cool
Think of another
Overview
You are the charm
Where night is a mist
I grew up on earth
White hand
Disapprove me
To make you use this power
Yeah, can't be anything good
Lost it in your dreams
You live alone
The bad boy
Living to the shame
Lucky in need
I never got a chance
Every moment made me believe
You’re giving it away
I made myself home
Everything is yours
Right behind the tree
When should we go?
Stand by and salute
Got a chance to finally feel it
With time comes your own reality
The money is with you
We had a shadow
Coldness taunts them
The waters of love
It’s all wonderful
The love of singing
To push your head to the ground
Someday
Between running and sleep
How easy it is
All the great things
Can’t do it tonight
Man-made chaos
Going on a dead end
Came into my body
Well done today
A punchline
Back in the game
Your image as a pillow
They were my friends
Or if you don’t know
This in the grass
Can I stay home?
My imagination just seems endless
We will probably meet again
Didn’t move my hair
We share our thoughts
We know it’s a good game
I'm not satisfied
Think it’s wrong
Sit still in this confusion
Up comes the rose
Like the king
A little more earth is kept cold
To reveal his love
Walk your life away
Say it anyway
Throwing his hands up
Refine all hopes
Hello there, hello there, honey baby
Hello, there it is!
And all three of you die
Grabbing my money
Tomorrow is mine
Someone from our desert
You don’t want to call your name
Resurrection
Save the world
That I'm good to you
Time to start anew
For the world
Take control of everything
The way you feel
It brings a smile
Take every bit
We had no control
Flashs of hell
Holy trick
Where our enemies will lie
Sitting awake
Release that feel
As soft as they can sing
She looks satisfied
Take this on and take it away
Starving spirits
The armies of yours
Surprised to be here
That terror of his father
I looked down into the deep ocean
She thinks too bad
Emptiness
What an almost noble goal
Can I help you?
A city town
I never understood the blindness
The sun breaks in awe
Waiting for the perfect day
Sunshine on your lips
He comes through
Nowhere, here
Come in there to dance
Stop crying all the time
Have never seen the day
Come to this place
The waves sound like steel
Emotions can't wash
It’s a corner
Set a new standard
How the fire is cooking
He may leave me alone
I'm having the time of my life
A breeze now blows
Your trash talk
Let us all rise
All that stuff
You’ve got some shoes to fill
The deeds of his children
Silver
How did you know?
I can fly over the stars
A girl's voice
Get in my mind
Hey babe
The shadow of rose
My holy friends
Lay down
They ain't made this perfect
We’ll all cry
Things I love about her
Some dogs from the town
To touch ourselves
Between my eyes
They’re all wrong
But on the other hand
Dark themes
Is this a dream?
And I shall win again
Where are you when you need me?
Let the world tremble
And you’re keeping me high
Where they lived the rest of their lives
Who dares to touch you?
And you're taking care of you?
Late one evening
That was a good time
Even the fan has a mouth
Fix it up
Through the wild world
You won’t pay the rent
I’ve been waiting so long
Your legs are deceiving
Where your mouth sinks
I don't want you to know
Open the window
Keep her as a name
The flowers next to the key
You won't get through this
It’s too late
Broken from orbit
Just after noon
In the new space
I love it so much
If you’re bringing me through
Well hello, you’re looking down
Got up inside and ready for our son
Where do you want to go?
We stand together
Climb up
Where he can kiss
Crossing a line
Unsparing for you
Cool sailing
Your love for your life
I'll be there every day
I’ll always be my lover
We've lost a God
Some down below
Turn your arms around me
Time slips away
We live in a nice place
Naughty but gentle
Watch my face
Wiped out in the graveyard
Walls too high
Blow our minds
Down out on the warm streets
Till you surrender
My heart goes out to you
Until my face is clear
Skippered my brain
The seagull
You all know
Underneath his yawn
One another belongs in all the worlds
Running through my head
Future's key to victory
These dreams
The heart of my soul
So do you mean to?
Another I’ll come home
Ever sorry
I just feel like I’m giving in
No family for you
With a shadow of my face
They take pleasure
This is the new music
At first, we need each other
My mother died
Hate ties the hood
With all the people in it
Till I die
Will never feel free
Trying to make sense
Smiling beside him
Painful time
Smiling’s own way
What else do you suppose?
Good to sleep in
My sun
We’ve all taken my fingers
Is gonna be rain by the boat
These past days
The key to time
And one of the seed holes
Turning it on
A time for closing time
We’re all friends
Throwing away my word
Help me if they're looking for it
The dreamless master of things
Son of a slayer
All hell breaks loose
The thunderstorm
Tune in every goddamn hour
Feeling pretty
Incoming powerful waves
The charm of spring
Save your mind
Can't fight truth
Me, my crazy lover
Until tomorrow
It’s really not fair
I want to go home
Just wander your free ways
Where everything goes
Silent Hour
To make me look good
In the same room
You’re just living
Rock up the hill
Into the hearts of men
Holy shit
Where we live
He has a mistress
I can't move
Snakes in the sky
I'm sorry
To find things of value
There are no newsmen
I’ve gone through so many
Right on your own skin
Talking the talk
So there you are
This is my secret so deep
You look tired
The square me
Please come over
When she smiles
The price of fame
Interminable mental play
And here we come this morning
Give the label
If you’re bringing it home
Selfies I'm sure
Why did we lose all hope?
Winds of revolution
Your blood on my green park
We need to stop pretending
Watching his eyes come and go
Too much and too little
Because of you
No surprise
The blue sky
Crude inside
Headed the bank
Always satisfied
Out of reach
When you look at her
Dreaming
From the mouth of a pig
Keep my lips flowing
A big smile
Whoopee now
I'm so wrong
Checkmate with you
A snake of pride
In my care
Can't hide
Turn my career around
She wasn’t sad
Take off your clothes
I take your hand
The kindness of man
He turned to the moon
Raise your voice
Sometimes the memory fades
The candle will burn
Take away the meaning
The best way to go home
Tired of feeding myself
It’s just like me
Gives you a good laugh
Fuck that statue
When it’s too late
Breaking in from nowhere
Springtime tree silhouette
He kept getting into my hair
Just like yesterday
Throw me all over yourself
All I want to do is pretend
No belief in it
Someone needs to hear
Foundling
An eternity
Enough of fame
Where it’s night
You’re so maddening
I’m a little sickened
It is over
Open mind
That I think I am
For the man
And I think you’ve done
Excuse me?
From here to nowhere
All of us getting fired
One of the wine-lips
He only a dream
The one-eyed thing
The only sensible person’s opinion
Down that dance floor
Coming here now
Don't catch me like I'm not here
The pool hallowed evening
Very interesting story
Brand new singing
Well, we're gonna get out
All I can do
Pray your sky
Looking down on me
The streams started to drain of colour
Strike back and try again
All I've been was love
I grew up in an echo
Why must I?
Life is running so slow
Had another title
Turn around
And half the door
Had no father
In the ground
Totally never gonna look the same
If you have
Stay near me
Talk the truth
Sick as a sack
Sick of having to follow the law
While moving across time
Walking behind the curtain
I’m getting high
I'll go and beat you down
Life in terror
Maybe I can find the light
We are all together
Verbal violence
I’m gonna find my tomb
You like a picture
Don’t wear your skirt
Crashing through your mind
So I’ve got the drunkard
With a dog
From your mouth
While we did sleep
Twenty-five minutes on the clock
Life loves a band
Maybe you can come back tomorrow?
Sooner or later
Son of the son
Ice across the sky
Looking for a reason
I want to change everything
Full of life
Morning I’m not so scared
And the darkness and winter
I think you’re well?
Being a commodity
An exact duplicate
This feels like a storm
Stands in the sky
An ideal place to show the world
My body changes
Taking those brainwashed whispers
The hopeless sorrow
The thing with the bells
I feel free
Ladybird, blind man's sweetheart
Walking down the street
Wake me up at home
Take me out of this life
Singing popular phrases
The guard is dead
Losing control over my body
Everybody’s alive
Revocation
Grows away
Rolling over into others
Put your love in you
He's nice as pitchfork
Heart's so sweet
I’m gonna join
Burn like a fluke
I’ll be by you
The only way out
Under my mattress
I’m here to take you apart
A princess shatters
Make some nice ladies day
Hated and saddled
Out of all the mirrors
People on Sunday know what I mean
Out of nowhere
I've got no time for it
Top of the mountain
There are dangers inside
Bullshit is just a weapon
Let it come down
Sunbeam sky
Day passes
Everyone else inside
The poison starts here
Thought to be a world apart
Panic in his face
Sacrifice your home
My own business
Anything but trash
You could teach me a lesson
Don’t sleep
That year the masters of archery were back
Down the road
My enemy gets a little older
White bubbles
No real sparkle
You’re been around for so long
Her vision for new life
Ask me one question
My world
Black or white
Star wars dreams
Now we are together
Eyes belong to me
Just plain stupid
Don’t waste your time
With my mind
I only care where I am from
To use your enthusiasm for me
To pierce all walls
Give me a chance
We’re all turned upside down
We’ve been the best
Ride in a little amusement
And there's nothing you can do
Ralts on a dusty trail
While I’m busy crying
Cut me a train
Time to sing
My neck is playing
Till you die
A doorbell rings
Deceive you
Our sides of ourselves
The city tomorrow
All these warnings
Over the summer sun
Knock on the doors
I’m looking at you
Oh don’t talk to me
Thunderstruck
The memory is like a cylinder
Seems pretty cool
Through the cracks
Painful and crazy
Behind you
Reminisces
Hey baby, what’s wrong?
I think it is all good
Grow old
And it’s no wonder
I will stay on them
Silence
Going home
What you look like in a photograph
Through my parents
Breathe it out
In our shame
Start working again
Visions
Don’t cry for a minute
All around the world
All the memories
I’m making music
Sounds like the shadow falls on you
Broke past you
The love of the flesh
Every final shot
Half empty
Well one night in the grindhouse
Tell her I'm fine
Some sweet song
The lace, balls, crackers
What will you say?
As for a voice that could rap
Fools you
Saw out my window
Dig them back up
Lay dead
The singing of a dying star
For my part
Nevermore
Through a clear glass
Straight to home
Ride along on the cloud
No one’s buying you
You don't feel so good
Blood moon
I know when I can’t tell
Distant thought
Watching the love seed snake
Floating in the sea
Shooting down traffic
We took you out of it
Hang on to me
From this place
I thought you were dead
Filled with bitterness
The sunlight fades away
Yellow things need you
I’m about to catch my breath
Shook myself up in this past
Just another fake
Love is born here
Don’t know when
Looking at you now
Until you throw my arse at me
Taking it out on you
Afraid of light
I'll miss you
He’s just another human being
And the whole sky
One of them’s lying
I feel fucked
You get on better with life
Going down the ways
Sticking your sweet little hooks
Never put up with it
I’ll be tomorrow
No voice is gonna stop me
Reaching for their waists
I've got so many sights on me
An amazing smile
This is a meaningless dream
Don’t ask for anything
On top of it all
Call me new
Too cold to be a lover
Throw yourself apart
Silhouettes in the night
I’m just taking your life away
You, it’s up to you
More quickly
I will move inside
Haha
Selling out the White City
Redrushing in and out
A man of steel
To make a game you were right
Locked in this shell
Caught staring at me
Hope I'll be around to add some perspective
Touch my breasts
Just fine
You know you’re a failure
We don't know why
I'm looking right at you
Road to happy endings
Lowest room
It’s awful
Burning something cool
Visions dancing in the wind
Attacking yourself
My real affection
I think he says it's for your cup of tea
Let it come to pass
He'd be proud of it
That movie was much too old to see
I want to stay in this town
I’ve got a resolution
Dream through the day
What did I say?
Stood by my grave
The milk of a ship
She’s stealing more things
To the west
Your more pressing duty
Behind them
I fell for the mavens
Those inside your head
The rainbow burst
My father’s voice
They’ve watched you bleed
Your habit
Great butler
You made it through
The curse
Hey, what are you doing?
Up to their bank
No laws
That's my kingdom
He doesze off
Live for my virgin year
Where all the way to hell
First put on a wrong
Won't that be pretty?
Find a prince
I’ve never had a love sound
Heaven for her
Everyone knows
A man can dance
Now I’ve got a job
Been sick and tired of telling you
Lucky charm
It was never mine
Where we go
You see me now
Awesome height and style
A haunting look
An hourglass I’m seen in the airport
Talk about your boss
But you should stop kissing me
Tomorrow may be a nightmare
Just to take you by your arm
Understood
Take him down
No longer know
I’ll be so damn tired
My spirit's immortal
Some nights in order
Just want you to know
There is no doubt I don't get higher
In the test case
First time
To turn through your infinite nights
That should be all on you
The desert country
Are the pills faster than our eyes?
Paint this romantic letter
Bring me out with you
New country
Still feeling tired
Fly through the sky
Blow my nose
You knew the same
Through her mind
I take you down
Speak the truth
It’s still you and me
Lady kneels for me
Told you she was dead
Swept by hypnotic wind
Couldn't ever lay it down
Just watch their skin crawl
She is right
Sweet pleasures
When I’m a woman
The health and the mind
We've got our sympathy
Such an overused sentiment
A warm dream
With the jam and the laughter
Just try to turn the pages
And we got to start laughing
Brushing his teeth
The centreline
A hallucinatory notion
A promise
It’s not your fault
Blood in veins
Brought you on
I feel invincible
Do the dishes
Me, that's what this is
We can go in this way
His love’s fine
Who’s doing it?
Leave it to them
A couple days ago
I'm outta here
Talk for years
I’m making it so easy
Made your promises
Just to pull the strings
Passing time
Poor situation
Dream of me
Come together
The fly of history
I think my own problems
You got one a minute ago
Make us laugh
That sunken prison
When the world dies
Now is the time
Once the mood turns bright
You’re no stranger
Beneath the crack of wind
No calling history
Down in Washington
A light that is broken
Life
A sister dreamed
That's what my mother is
A lost age
Fools, idiots and bunnies
The Lion, the Hare, the Bumblebee
Are you awake today?
While I lay lying there
One example
At peace
The sun smiles
All will be fine
Deep white sea
Get at the inside
Good. Hand in hand with dreams
Just putting it down
Swift and round
I shall move from him
A highway under one foot
All through the night
I feel so bad for you
I looked at you’ve never seen
Send us your treasure
We sold all our hearts
Tune your windows
Time away
Got anyone watching?
In the safety of the Holy Grail
She’s never a virgin
And cuddle a deer
Throwing a call in the wind
Sit side-by-side across the street
Cupid's thousand doos
Try to hear your frustration
These strange tears
After all is said and done
Let me tell you about it
That's gotta be a mistake
Merry spoons
Pretend I feel
Watching birds from cloud tops
The roads are narrow
Sweet dreams, I’ll stay
What made you think I could escape?
Beat you up like a beast
She's just looking at us
Love Is falling apart
Makes me a little scratch
I’m not your boss
Now that I have this you
Calling the age out
The sun at the shore
Brought in from the dead
This is your world
Somewhere, we are
Really cool
It gets you down
He can't seem to walk alone
Make your sun flow
Ready to put up with one disease
The future from around here
There isn't time to sit down
Head to the news
Preceding on his own death
I wanna see
Down in winter
I don’t know if you were good or evil
Came straight down
Give me more money
Dreamers of tomorrow
I’ll start another job
Feeling like a moth
Cover up the roads
Can I have a friend?
Hey look out there
Skinny eyed deer
Don’t die
Where time is running out
I'm afraid she’d go
The noise fades away
Hey, everyone right now
Lost- of our nation
Lost love in shadows
Don’t you feel the force of tomorrow
Another journey through the night
Vanished
Clear line up
Back to sleep
Visions that will change forever
A feeling I can feel
Lean forward and hard
Until I can do something
The servants looked away
How fucking nice you sound
I’m gonna die
Just making it more like a city
So what about them?
Snakes likes bibbles
Like magic
I’m leaving it at home
The drummer can hardly get
Took it too far
A flying tram
You will do whatever you like
Called your child
Way down on the dragoon
I'm going out for a dance
Now, what’s left
Does not sound right to you
Sitting in jail
Rakes in the rain
Sitting within a fog
I still feel pity
She made a show out of me
It's getting cold up in the morning
Please settle for a present
She opened fire
Cool that mind control train
Blows out
To support the dreams
Watching us fall
She feeds me
I’m keeping you
With lips that have now sold it
The sky is falling
Please please let me ride
I like it too
Live your life
Then I look in the mirror
Tears in the green
The static of your paradise
Hang in there and stick by me
The essence of our life
Self-conscious
Streets out of the sea
Could not find the time to go to work
Sleep and write your tired lyrics
I sat alone
What he will do
Fly all over the sky
Sell the title
She is in such a rush
Kissing her with pen and heart
I came to save you
Feel it grow empty
Born without a word
Memories fly
You’re a weed
I'm right beside you
The stars shout
All aboard my ship
I just love you
As soon as I hear you
Falling into darkness
Long and dead
Come on, come on
Floating before the sun
See the forest in the eyes
High on the crappie
Go to his place
A vast tail of debt
What's next?
Lose your leisure
Let it be here
Take a little time
Saying it in short order
They're all together
Or thumps of grass
The world's way
Dark smoke
Dreams are worth living
Came as a merry man
From time to time
I love you too
I'm fine with it
The nightmarish mind
When it comes time for me
I need you to do this
Our eyes burn
Don’t care
She will see
I knew he’d die
Freaking
But then again
Been away for days
The guy goes down with you
Keep your secrets
No man knows it
If it could love you
Had the edge
A midnight vision
Beat a big time
The expectations that you had
A planewalk
It’s not like you've ever seen me
Thinking-glass
Caught the fire
Trying to get away
We know you’re dead
I grew up around being scared
Swimming through your dreams
Your love became human
His life's like a drug
None
Of the human balance
Your stomach’s on fire
Here comes the jealous
During the last dance
Abandoned pet
When she looked at me with blank eyes
Reminds me of my abandoned cars
Sounds pretty tight
Living as you seem before
How easy it seems
On the fence
It’s tough on her
Repossessions
Some damn authority
I’m getting old
Nothing lasts forever
Painwave
Carefully to see the truth
My bones buried
A tight green flag
Burning the house
Destroy my soul
Fly down the street
In heaven
Your life is no longer a cakewalk
In the snow
Oh your damn heart
I would have wanted
Turned out to be great
Found you
We had friends dead for generations
Painful rhythms
No one knows how long you walk
Tears of pain
Come on over
Two holes of sliver
Take a lifetime
So what you say
Preserve, protect and let down
The time flies
A baby face
Here I am
No good to see
Trying to win by splitting pixels
Or I could lose it
As it rains
Within six or seven hundred yards
I want you all to think about
There's no time to waste
People start to hate her
An angel of God
You are so young
Who will take us back?
Be here in the house
Just putting up this girl
I’ve never seen anyone talk
That day at the bridge
Please, I've got your little boy's money
Give it the name
Do something you didn't mean to do
As near as you can get
Seventh sun
Bring them my love
I see you shine
I am a big fan
And soothes my heart
I’ve been promised
My woman’s human breast
Got ideas
It’s hard to finish
Treasure and the magic
Immolate yourself
All the things I used to do
A man of principles
You ain't really home
And she came and danced
Better terrify the breeze
Can you see it through
The star
Die
Don’t you care?
Speed me up
Bring her down
Ain't all that matters
It’s your mouth
I know it was the last time
Is it running here?
Where all of you were
So call me manager
Ring of fire
Miss me by the hand
Reaching the pinnacle
Addicted to love
And now I see
Rainbows and dogs
We must stay together
Every day my soul is weeping
Blow by the sea
Took you to hell
Cover me with tape
A very stupefying time
I’m moving too slowly
Thinking of everything
We flew across the sky
I’ve seen my father
Our lovingly dream
One hundred times the size
The moonbeam blade on the brown citadel
A smile opens my eyes
Just as I found you
To be a cliche
O 'em all
While a person hangs his head
The amazing tale of music
Headband worn over the hood
On the bridge
Don’t let him see
See those blurred ones?
To the town I grew up in
As it stands now
This won't have to be bad
Friends I held
No love on ice
All over the city
Memory blown
You now become bored
You take the shine off your blue
A glass of red
When the sun glowed
Me neither yet
Downed the river
Both on my high horse
What's the meaning?
Battle on my mind
Strain the old thread
But you know it doesn't matter
Your royal heart
Through the teeth of my own band
Just the way I feel
Brought chaos
Another chain of censorship
Blood being poured down the streets
Underneath this haze
Lock in when someone leaves
Every thing I did
Some day you will be here
You have all the money
We’re all in love
I’ve been lifted
Extremely satisfied
I’ll not keep my head out of the water
What I can do
The charm of dreams
About my music
Future cargoes
Watching people die
Take that hair from me
A sleaze
Broken Heart
Alone in a room
His hand in mine
Different colour palette
Should've done
Laughing and crying every day
His office
Right back where we started
Run in circles
Everything you've been told
Giving you a lifetime's worth
Can hear my silhouette
I think I just sank
Thoughts could be pretty
Smells like muscle
This game
Me and my voice
Reparation
I won’t go
Just a friendly smile
Waiting for you to find it
That shit taste like acid
Let it out
He wakes me up
Never got to tune
My life all around
A large ball of fire
Fantastic world
Ripped up in painted papers
To find you
Or: To look into the abyss
I’ve done fine
At least now they do laugh
I don't want anyone else to know
I’m ready to sing
Everything seems fine
Getting old
We are still at the bridge
She should move on you
Spungent on smoke
Say they met somebody else
The mark of decay
Entire nation is already dead
Looking for you’s last minute overture
All power to the devil
Please don't go to sleep
You don’t know me
Disillusionment
Freedom just won't let me die
I hate my father
You know it’s hard
Watch out on the lonesome corridors
Tell me what you mean
Goodnight
Move me further away
In a dream
Totally cool
You all pushed me away
I’m still lonely
My giggle
You’re alone
Smell, taste
To bring love
You gave me a parade
Escape-scene
Nowhere near
The purists call me an evil lust fiend
We shall see you every morning
I know you’ve seen
Just you
Like bandits
I’m a hero
She did you good
Just another sad little animal
A big china shelf
Have become involved
What are you’re saying to yourself
The old fountain
My grandfathered machine
Empty in your hand
Pretty bitch
One thing, a thousand things
My childhood dreams
I’m sick to death
Tune in how you feel
I thought I was going to die
Never look down
I have a secret soul
All business
Looking down on you
And we’ll go as far as we can
Close-up art
He’s lost sight of me
Drinking in this world
Out of love
From the pages of the old songs
I’m always on you
Believe you once and for all
Paint the sky blue
Not like the time of dawn
Leave you desolate
Need some reason to die
They began the sad days
What else will he do
You said you wanted to go home
The absence
Represent the past
Human beings can do nothing but watch
I don’t care what you say
Needing to reach for the shore
I’m all things to get
Memory and imprisonment
Can't you just be as sweet as she says
Moonlighting in every line
I’ll never find
Where you went wrong
Stop and spin
Strung up around demons
The morning star
And I know that
Be in love
Some great songs
Inside my heart
Ain't nobody doing it
Watching his face
The wet dream
Sorry just never find it
From death and mourning
Make something new
With a headache
Own it and play with it
Anybody knows
Stars a million volts down the line
Anywho’s mind is mine
By the hand
Jump on this girl
The ghosts in the sky
Invented
You know what? I can’t be your muse
In their blood and sweat
I’ll be sick
His arms are tied in chains
Since making love in love
Give money away
Spend the evening in town
Modern daylight
We need someone to look after us
Let me say it again
Dance
Up to now
Walking in free will
Scarlet eyes
Some dead girl
Try not to wake up someone
Give them time
By the waves
With luck
I had met him
Take the moon out
On your knuckles
Let you see tomorrow
That made my life easier
The books came flying
Dust the lighter I wish
Across the heavens
Dark streets you dragged through
He’s running away
A kid on my tomb
Irony
Let alone beat it
What a blessed day
Down through the eyes of a dying fool
She threw away her pillow
Two laws
And still I’m human
Up close and personal
Staying awake at night
Locked in my mind
I want to kill you
Do what you can
You know what I mean?
Its a hell of a fight
Love of mine
Convinced that I'd follow them
Things will be better and worse
I’ll live in his statue
Don't hurt him too much
I hope she won't survive
Fucking stumbled across a lie
Looking for me
We’ve got to pass on
Who cares?
First to take control
The junkie bum
Ice cream and kiss you
Does this look like me?
I take a fall
Son of a bitch
Don't laugh at me
Dead in the streets
Don't piss me off
Dropping
I sing the blues
He thought I was wrong
The forces of evil
Into the glow
A bowl of flesh to eat
He made me love you
Help me get out
Drop our love
Somewhere down there
Morning can’t get far
Lost there
Where are you?
Underneath your heat
Please pass it on
I’m always cold
A view of disappointment
Throw your love away
Wonder why you’ve gotta be here
We almost forgot...
We shouldn't pay attention to you
I see through all of your sorrow
Say what you want
A good scene
Foolishness—what to me
Vows to tear you apart
Like a girl
Oh you’re just too high
Years pass in silence
The love-maker
Put it to use
Full of sorrow
And he makes mistakes
Falling rain
So we like to become good at what we do
And you’ve never found the security
Who’s at fault here?
Please no longer see
We all met at the zoo
Separate your vision
Strip everybody naked
Because I'm awake
Say something, right now
Feel at home
Anything that makes you want to scream
What you dream
But what does the world look like?
Shadows in my ears
Am I supposed to sound like a nightmare
We stay here forever
Hey, you look good
In a big room
No man stands still
Like I said
We saved that woman
You’re the star
Seeing the needle fall
No matter what
And didn't say I was sorry
Saying he won’t take me if he’s right
Waiting for you to be satisfied
All day long
You’re never there
Finesse
Keeping it quiet
That's where I’m going
Just a blue sky
These are love letters
Picture a message
Still alright
Just so I know what you think
No matter how stupid I am
Set your cage inside
Let me feel your arms
Come on now, that leaves the room
I won’t look on you
I’m beyond attraction
Remember you’re my friend
Calling for peace
You’re only a prince
Then go on your merry way
A chord that crosses a bridge
In a bubble
Their haircut suit
The mountain art
Stand beside me: Looking into your eye
Chump me
Your place of honour
This time I will follow’s way
I’ll drown in you
He's just trying to understand
Talking glass
Feel the fire and weep
A place to hide
Leaves your friend at the window
I’m almost done
Smooth as a feather
Dancing below
See all the emotions and movements
Speak like a girl
Did I hurt you?
Good night
Behind the lights of your dreams
Anyone knows me
Raining down
Kicking the barrel
Like a newspaper story
Shes the ground with a dead anchor
That's a line to all my friends
White out with the sun
Snowy blue
Inside the sanctum sanctorum
When he comes home
To the moon
All along the lines of life
Tell me where she went to
Broken relationship
Your present moon
Real happy time
Attracted to you by the noise
And then it hurts
Your fever sufferer’s created
I have no new money
From thorns to watery eyes
Someone else wants to know
The rumor for eternity
Does it look weird?
You’re an idol
The appeal of art
Stop cringing
Think inside the mind
Seemed pretty easy
Want me naked
Summertime in your love life
You get goosebumps
To sleep safely
It's like a train of sickle pals
So don't interrupt me
Come on ladies
Breathe quick
I'll take a girl if she calls you
I can see you turning
I’ve been watching you for hours
The line fell in love
Let's go over again
That’s where I am
How to beat that teacher
That deep inside you’ve got lots of trouble
To the tune of Tom Baker records
Selling fuel to every boy
Just so you know
Speak of me
A divine personality
You look strong
Our story
Let's do that
Pretty innocent girl
The voices have been silenced
Like that she goes slow
Love sells
I'll introduce you
Some mighty names
Maybe I shouldn’t be changing
Broom together
Where there is a black hole
These trials and tribulations
Sweet lips
Be away from it all
Try
A treasure that will come back
Laugh in the face of every belief
Lay down on top of the mountain
Let the wolves off the trees
They sure never knew
A baby born all alone
An ending
Yes, yes, yes I’m bored
Selling them saddles
No broken bones
Stand out as a disappointment
Burn my memory
Lost life
I don’t care how old you are
The god who created us
Beat your wheel
No pain
Fucking rock of the night
You’ll be sorry
Won't make you happy
Like my life is a dream
Well, you must be forgetting
The hate’s starting to show
And yet I know
Wishing nothing but paradise
My blade lit up like night
Spading through a dead thread
If you were breathing
Talking to those words
Take one last kiss
Smells like rotten gum
We didn't do anything to us
I will always be there
Holds them down
Eyes that are kinder than snow
All around me
Where I’m bending over backwards
Your fucking own home
Your wheels turn
Locked my bed
How she’d slip away
Freedom from fear
Too fucking bitter
A rock star now
Not you yet
People get treated
I’m old
All over the street
You’re feeling a little wistful
Sorry sorry it was so busy
I’ll be in prison
Mistakenly, wrong
Watching starfish crawl
Push that button
The thrill of falling away
You will find me
A wave of love
Wake up tomorrow morning
Expose each other
Our lady goddess
The dancing cliché
Wish I would die
You’re all still alive
Time to take on ourselves
Yeah...
You’ve heard me say once
And you’re alone
The seeds are planted
To need a bit more
No one wants to get along
A vase
I feel alive
Going from sympathy
Tears fall under a sky
Loneliness can be everywhere
No regret
Greeting me
Sick as your eye doesn't shine
Looking around at the universe
I had a dream the other day
He’s all I ever wanted
Been waiting for you I’m not satisfied
His guiding hand
Starting with honey
To argue
The guts come out of his mouth
I grew up watching you’re all right
Unbreakable dreams
Too much money
Driven into a rage
An enemy
Sorry for my youth
White rhinestone streets
Life is a trick
You are wondering
It feels so nice
I never saw you like this before
Holy gun
Come in and I will sleep
We grew apart
Distilled down her heart
At the start
The future turned darker
Need every stroke
Sweet voice
Lying in the sun
The fuel inside
Curtain shrieking mirror
The force of truth
To make myself stronger
Bound apart
This movie looks for this peace
My child’s fault
Feeling powerful
You know how I feel
Like he’s a lunatic
We’re outside
With my lips wide open
The limelight
A feather in a jar
The devil wants you
All too strong
Time to smile
Fill him with cold tears
Lovely gunboat
And that we all belong
Won't go away
Here to see my tomorrow
She did well
Last night I walked inside
You were growing too slow
This thread ran out of an hour
Lady someday
Scales the gallery
Watching you burn
Now I’m taking off
You’ll be alright
I looked it up
New horses
Someone named Willsell
Why is it time to change your image?
Let's meet again
I don’t need to watch it last forever
A corner of the room
Looking in the mirror
With every trick
The golden test
My soul was made in a crucible
Eager to catch someone else
Wonder what we forgot?
Sail the sky
She’s running down
Your white hair
I won't blame you for anything
But you have nothing
Place of hatred
Dream it out
Under the saddle
Get down on your knees
Won’t look
Join our long and happy day
That is now nearly to come
Let me let you know
Same old shame
So far away
I’ll put you to sleep
Got to finish it
As soon as my darling dream comes true
You used to be a wallflower
I know what my name is
I’m gonna ruin your life
I'm just stuck behind
Alone
Will make our moonshine
You’re up high
A kid walking around
And the airlocks in the saddle
And in this dream
From the depths
Hard to leave
Cool; you’re trying your best together
I hate it
It’s a prison
Spread the ashes
And then it’s all over
Things we talked about in my youth
His hand is moving
Like buried fire
Peacock fishing
Feel the thrill of freedom
Then sell his soul
Under an absent night
Holy chance
Some of the best for you
I want to see you now
What the hell do you mean?
Ice cream from the top
Isn't it better for everybody to be safe?
Everybody said we did it wrong
Just get me out
Behind the long and soft glow
Watching her fall
So much of him
Sick of all this loneliness
Put my life on hold
Your passion is growing
Watching you shower
The first kiss is a memory
Stars are burning white
Take me to the moon
They’ve got faces against mirrors
Fighting to get through
And to no one in particular
And I wanted to tease you
You’re in me
We’ll get you wet
A thief's play
Long noonday
He is the father
Bling my eyes
Well, you’re a businessman
We’ll see you soon
Don't give me the bed
This city will be in ruin
The same way to trade down
Some sailors cannot walk
When it’s warm in the sun
That I never leave
Now where we’re from
Lost my faith
Got her love
You can get paid more than I’m asking for
(For a reason in your mind)
All the evils
Selling us rotten apples
My little work
Turning into my body
Totally ornery
Honey wets a month
With out the misery
It’s okay
Making a pyre
You can decide what you want
That will be obvious
Sick
Shine the other lights
Filled with Curses
Hold your seat
Full of shit
Lie full face to true
Say my name
Keep going
Somewhere in a forgotten way
Don’t attack me
Where the devil is stalking you
Looking for my springtime
Till you’re awake
That sometime ago
All of my friends are singing
Turn on the display
On a massive scale
When they do
A thousand strange images
Too much to do
Snow from the clouds
Do you know where I am?
Buckets full of wealth
Mouth to mouth
I can be as much as I want
You call this her treasure
Hand-to-hand combat
Under the skin
A pack in the air
Roar me
And rids the world of evil
Fly away and soar
To a devil
The rope was loose
Lapping your feet
Oh my god
Though I looked more alive
I am desperate to get out of here
Make it better
A friend of mine’s death
So glad I sat there
The lonely emptiness
Never try to connect
Blow his head off
They talked past each other
New toys
All I want is you
On a moon day
My heart is the only shadow
First man in the world
Rose red
Always sigh
Where I can hang out
His sandalwood is unhangin'
When anyone’s coming over
Well I’m worried
Nail the strings
And teach your children love
Or I’m gonna turn into somebody else
Caught up in the crowd
This time today
My only source of strength
With your blood collection
Murder by the sinner
It’s an act
Feel the lightpour
Mind always calling me
Send her for supper
Raining tomorrow
When’s a girl with the right or wrong
In song
Of Angels
The body around me
Paint me
Feeling the thunder in the sky
All they say
You can see it now
Jesus Christ
Another man on the bench
Last night in hell
Cause I know your words
Somebody else’s in the kitchen
Too busy thinking
Where I’d leave you
Wild and wild
I’m giving away something to anyone
Letting a man down
A million people
Sail around the world
Through a window
Told me to hide my face
Becoming your own brother
Trying to ruin his glory
Set the image
Accept and abandon
And I've got it in me
Anyway you brought me here
Give-tale
I took him to war
The decay
And at what price
The god of tomorrow
Come to a crossroads
With an old friend
If we all die
From the spinners
And two laws
I'm going to kick the butt
Waiting for you to pass
Get it out of my head
Took my sister there
All the houses in town
Trust
Stare on shadows
Say it isn't so shy
Silence’s dragging down
You look ready
While everybody else is away
Crashing at night
To cry the song
The unknown
We pass down the music
You’re a merry song
Too slow, too slow
We all started talking
What will be done
I’m getting down
Dainty game
It’s all his fault
Skinny red-faced
Your heart will freeze
Fly blind
This is the real world
He lied
Come on honey
I’ll lose you
The moment is coming
Take away your power
He’s alive
It’s a duel
All these nightpaths
They wave
Gave me my arm
Speak your minds
Your voice is fucking in the distance
Rather hungry, I’m going to kill you
The rings out
Great game
Don't let the space kiddos win
Sweet meets sour
It’s only fair
I’m still young
Walking through town
Real crazy
Everyone I know
The dawn of rationality
Silent for a little while
My ways are open
First and only chance
You’ll be okay
Make yourself sad
That you abandoned
Rather cry for Christ
To what you had to say
I saw you through
All right
Crooked tramp
Oh yeah
Within a month
I’ll throw them the punch
To my fourth year
You don't do much till today
You're a bar
No enemy anymore
Throw me into all kinds of patterns
What’s all those paintings out there?
Tears off their stammering bottles
Help us after this is all over
May fall apart
Just found the company
All God wants me to be
Bouncing kite
Maybe tell you my goddamn name
To find out how I can trust the world
Make a deal with you
My bluesy eyes belong in the sky
A vacant part
They’ve got no pulse
The shots the rays-screens shot me
In your heart
An endless stream of love
Should you cry?
You heard about that
Every time I read
And I died this year
I don’t wanna be anybody else
How do you say?
You can have life
Look at that smile
Raining clouds
Cold take the water
I lived a nightmare
Didn't you know you were coming all the way?
Your bones belong on his shoulder
I went down
Glowing from autumn
Someone else will find the ground
Like dreams
Your lips hurt
Thinking about you
The flowers coming down
Bring me notes
Till now
My bones have not been played
Still getting lost
Say something different than the order
Downstairs watching you face the world
Mind when I had eyes
Stomach full of shit
Dancing alive
For with love
She won’t show
Oh, you’ll never know
The marksmen on bones
And see the great light
Yes, we will
My shadow maiden
Never listen to you
And I know this because I’ve got to it
Run through the door
Just keep away
Aired on a mist
Leave to dance
War asks me to surrender
Your hand on my heart
Move your fucking mouth
King blows
Complete
This should be with you
Have loved you
Something new, something to take away
Give me the name of John Doe
One last time
My life is a blank slate
Shout your name again
I’m weary
Through a gap
His habit of asking me if I got a look
Either we sing or die
One last thing
See how stupid she is
Wipe you dry
Little pictures of you
Anytime you put your hat on
I’m naked inside
Didn't feel so bad about it
Stranger in our hair
Putrid and terrible
No apologies
Can you find me?
Blushing
The curtain calls
Take my eye off my pillow
No longer going to tell
Talk the gutter
It's just way over your head
And you’re so uptight
Disturbing our shyness
Walking across the road
Don’t forget
Passed the nation
To pull it up
The stars are seen higher
The destruction that is laid within
Beyond a shadow
Reaching the door
It takes him down
Can be the sweet side
When our hands touch
Try and let the nightmare end
Trying to seduce him
Meet the boss
Son of slaves
All I can say
Dressing, or in a wheelchair?
Dreaming of disaster
Rain in the streets
Have the strength
Everybody from inside
To go on the rampage
I’m sorry you’re stuck
I gotta shake my world apart
This is her life
It’s not my night
Everyone said you were
To turn into a petrified animal
Kill the dude
Find a reason to fight
Protect and support her
Mouths are planted
Falling asleep is hard
To touch you and your dark sides
Maybe you don’t feel like it
Cutting into the heart
Friends and family
It is all behind you
Give me your precious words
Iron hands, ghost of a dream
Walking from a volcano
You gave away everything
And yet you’re smiling
And when we reach for her
Talk your pipe dreams
I'm almost feeling the beat
I hope you won’t care
A song about greatness
Lonely souls?
Shut your doors
You want to be funny
Hand me a pencil
You left the army out in the open
An art in the kitchen
Oh yes, I see you’re right
Now take me back
And I will die tomorrow
Inter-generational timeframe
Going to watch
The tide is round
Sorry, what do you think?
Another down year
The only reason I'm awake
I’m here to say
Sign me in
To go for the perfect match
I just met her
Take in all the rules
To you and me
Blood still breathing
Droping bells
It's hard to find
Excessive force
They could be dangerous
The White House salute
Someone else’s doing it for you
They won’t look down
On the run
Yellow snout
I’m busy restlessly
Please support us
Empty evil
Your broken back
I’m so glad you're here
The end times
He can't stop me
Left of you
In it we run, walking distance
Trying to befriend new people
Too good to be true
All things you’ve seen
I’ll use them to change my mind
Too deep for your head
Across the water
The action is good, that you can breathe
You look so sad
All my hearts are in your pocket
With God there
Your dirty little sheets
Cover the frame
Little girl dreaming
If you stayed here
Against the wall
I’m at home
Little sister
I’ll be your mother
Put off crying
Our hearts know
Overcome the blues
For a day
You’ll die tonight
It took me years to lose
Digital footprints
Her God-given style
Gonna kill you
Come on in
And again
My earpiece
What's wrong with her?
When we’ll meet again
At first
The sky is my deck
Eternal sunset
Sympathy seeps into you
Downing the ceiling
Pitiless-eyed blindsiding
Looking out for myself
Far from adrift
On the catwalk
Suck my heart out
Dream together
I wonder what lives in that hell?
Coming from within
I miss you
Yes, the old way
This is the coolest movie I've ever seen
I guess so
Tell your love to me
When you drag yourself down
While in prison
The spiritual postulate
Fire up your mind
That to you
They hate you
Another time, another time
Starting singing after she leaves
A new world
At a mealtime
As we were killing time
With white clothes
The widow
Something will come
Heart of my heart
Oh, no thought comes to me
The people like food
Why has it all been left to us?
Standing next to each other
Heaven will be under a row
Excessive drinking
Water falls
Ride to the end of time
The only thing to know
Headlights shine
Shhhh
Naked and lonely
Can't find our nose
Eat me alive
The truth before all the lawsuits
I feel the pressure of all the stars
Drive me back
Moving from one to the next
Pours their heart out
Dream about the shore
When little ones always want him
Eager to meet the cat
Heyyyy you at the food hall
Tears for speech
Lights out from us
Don’t take up your morning
Poetry on fire
Dancing stock footage
I'll kill you
And we're going home
Call to arms
Watching the sun rise
My two sons, mine and mine
It’s bad enough
Well here comes the good news
No matter how beautiful your body is
Mother and lover
I feel the need to tell you
I’m alone
You’re really alone
First of all, let me show you the doors
Thought all of this will be fine
A collection of bad deeds
Up for anything
Out here today
Then you’re free
Hear her scream
Sacrifice yourself
Walls thin and proud
But it’s dying
Kicking the clown
Rock you up
One hundred, two hundred times over
Half a dozen presidents
Love me some fruit
Hopeless in search
Night and day
Little Paulie maybe?
The darkest shadows
He dies for you
All of you falling apart
My dream is watching the sun rise
I can help you
Escape the world
Damn, this is how you paint a story
I’ve never known
The concept of a university
Speak badly of myself
This moment comes to us
Time can turn purple
Play the catch
Under the stage
We might let the shard go
Been up all night
Reminds me of how I feel
Singing over my song
One day
Let's take this from the heart
Let's get round of it
How to make you feel
You keep crying
Everything I've been through
A book of my soul
Where men like that
I know you’re fine
Everybody's missing your face
We should forget him
I wanted you to keep quiet
No move
Down to the rest
Bright fingers
You’re a gung-ho gun
Not right now
And I’m up
Your heart beats in a jar
For this is your home
Slow like a plant
Till I get myself back
Feel good for a moment
Modern takes a shine to her eyes
And no more lies
The bells ring
Got the wrong sound
Careless heh
To make you want to lose your peace
Taking pride in ourselves
Come down all alone
Are you here?
Never goes away
Mother is his bridge
My train took you so far
Admit it began with you
True life and an hourglass vision
A worthless rag
Let's go dance
My father left me
Can I see?
Cool
Your love is calling
Grandma died as she sailed the sun
His turn at last
I feel like a band of crazy thugs
Well I know where you’re parked
Oh God, I see your face
Stealing from a soulless eye
A mysterious future
I gotta be with you
Spinning the same hum
We each must pay attention
That's how dangerous I get
The sun kissed the blue
Rather tease
Going on all the time
Find it just the right way
Intense pleasure
Find the truth
I keep disappearing
Let the breath of success run
Got no show
Dirty dreams are turned upside down
Like a phoenix
She’ll be alright
An immortal flame
Nothing to do but complain
Warm memories
A drug addict kid
To tempt you
Hoping to get on your feet
Caught our money
Just like the average lothario
Visions of my own death
Only good dreams ever make the lie
Fly there's no hell
As new as she appears
You seem so new
And you’re ours
Walking in the night
Adorably close to nothing
Well, I don’t mind
You may have to keep in mind
The holy synagogue of the old testament
You asked him if…
Once again, he brings you nowhere
Cover with a wet velvet rope
Incentive shows
Laughing in my head
Hey look at me
And you've never seen his worst?
A lake of fire
Woke up in a furnace
Like the future
Walking around on the street
Modern slavery
Glides down in his lap
How I grew up in America
Know you’re a friend
Without the sun
Green beer at the breakaway
Here I come
Cast out the darkness
Burning down the middle ground
Making love to a dead lover
Shiver red hair
How do you know?
There are some minutes until tomorrow
The man with no name
We wanted the music
Floating in the air
Too strong for you
Perfect solace
Just like me
I’ve found life
As warm as you can touch
I could go
I keep growing
Got the phone tower
Fire and fury
Carefully thinking about tomorrow
You’ll not be afraid
I'll play some good games
Fireflies fly
Drop all your crap
What do we say tomorrow?
A drug-crazed rage
I have met my mother
With clear eyes
That she’d found
Lost the stars
Make me glad
Come on, boy
Such a beautiful time
They know you’re looking through your lens
Turned me round
She took a glass
Stranger on a mission
Snowy picture
Dismissed man’s beliefs
Down with a revolution
Song for a boy
Scrolling along the city street
To be buried with your tail behind
Music's called religion
Over time
Care to play this song
A-going-down
I feel so broken
The people and voices of presidents
Emotionally great
Paper cigarettes
Chasing an ever-increasing appeal
How you’ll be
When will it end?
The enemy walks now
Jealousy like a girl
To prepare myself
Bad ass over again
I can see the sun shining
He died a fat man
By the star towers
Put down the dead
A key chord
Always keep my little princess smiling
The taste of flame
Mad and miserable
True doge
Make up a story
Waking up drunk
He used his lonely desperation
Come at me
Shocker dreams
My verse
I walked down this road
Look what you did when you took care of me
Ride me through this hellhole
Ever looking for your way
Through the emptiness
We can only dream
So need a two sided smile
I won’t tell
Memory...
Stands outside this room
Overtonight today
No arms are spare
Tell me she’s telling me her true name
We can walk down the street
Hey man
Open my eyes
Where's the bathroom?
The rap music in my head
Wherever you can ride
But you still took it from me
Just waiting for the break
Supposedly over us
Into the human world
No one’s feeling much
Who’s right?
Get a tan
Looking through the window
I'm supposed to move heaven
Love is at stake
Ten but no one is talking
And thought he would keep a secret
In the interest of my son
I was afraid of him
Rather find your friends
A loose stitch
Battle ready for the outside world
In this room
When you’re standing beside me
Absolutely true
Voices within me
Out of harmony
Trying to be popular
Let me be
This town
You come through with me
The old ways
Sick and angry
Better than kings
To another world
To break the silence
A while ago you used to see me
I need your help
Cut through all the dryers
Got everything?
Blowing us out
Lose faith
I feel down
With the mamma's ring
Your juice and nothing else
Ummmmm, how can I sit on my hands?
Fists of hay
The last curtain
Didn’t touch you
What are you afraid to say?
Many people on top
You have things in your heart
Gonna show it off
All through town
If only there were a trade
Sweet white sun
Unsold secrets
Now live a dream
Slow as a snail
Drawn my senses
Need you ever stop
And you’re watching
Because you’re my lover
His flesh overtakes his bones
Shake your chair
Your medicine brings me to nowhere
The theme of the show
To be cool with the beginning
A fly in the night
Block
Tell all of us
Hope I found a better place
Turned into a drain
The way we belong
How you spoke
This is going to be him
Singing to the sky
In my ways
Someone calls you the enemy
Strike a nerve
There are forgotten skeletons
Take your soul
How I feel whenever I feel dirty
Holy, this is so wrong
From the empty little floor
Spending all of my money
What you did to me
It took her by surprise
Stop this slutty ways
I'm well, but stay away
Fuck it
Selling it all
Boring and endless
Reaching me
We made promises
Learn me what I know
Borrows the lyrical rhythms
No waste of time
Let your heart beat
Those flowers that used to lie on the ground
Doing your own thing
I come from such a place
He’s the only guy to sleep
Where will you go?
Looking down
Watch the sun shine
Because I’m such a shame
Dream is over
Way down here—there’s a hole in the heart
One hand on your shoulder
Don’t you agree?
One of you’ve become famous
Doesn't look like my heart
Touch me when you cry
Wipe our records clean
Sweet and cold
Don't lose me
Lead me home
All the buildings fall down
The pig here
Cut it out of the sunshine
The blood of King Ludwig
I should feel free
Where did your name come from?
I feel a burning sensation
It’s my son
Free and free
Something that never quite existed
Kids can look at you
I wasn't thinking for six weeks
Sitting like she’s dead
I’ve got no interest
Changes matter less
I could only laugh
The prelude
Before we started
I’m cold and lonely
It’s an idol
I don’t see why it is said?
Your skin is dying
I was going through all these shows
At that time
Inaing indecision
Ride the ocean
To bare the hardest battle
I’ll fill your space
When we meet again
Immediate triumph
Bloodlines
Asap is a blessing
Made a bargain
Where's the soup?
You’re mine
Touch my bed with her fingers
Freaking the wind
Meets attraction
So, I’ll be right here
One solitary hour in despair
A life free of suffering
Come to finish this sorrow
Feeling so tired
Man in shining armour
Your mother said my adage's up
Make it sweet
Got a sign
The breeze breaks
Money is awful
I feel my own sweetness
Sweet to waste
Heading away
Absolutely
Rhyme glistens
Hanging in the mountains
Wet, sweaty things
The dog now tramples
So bring it back to life
On the highway
Don’t leave me alone
Finding your own salvation
If it’s fucking broken
Bump my baby mouth
The message of love
I can’t say with any certainty
Light, and low
Killing the enemies
My vision grows dark
You’re waiting
Far enough now
Things seem to slip away
All around the table
Here's to you
Narrow the jaws
Watch as a weapon
Eyes on her lips
Simpleton's foreskin
Take us down
Why’ve you never been the same?
You could smell those innocent things
It's so heavenly
The song is not the song
Whose baby’s to know?
To paint your father
We just burst with laughter
That's the truth
Leave a good word
Just like an old soul
I don’t want to be his friend
Highway without my wand
The only time I feel like you
Made with no vision
Her body
But where do you get the government money?
Stash the secret jewels
Recruiting my buddy John the Apostle
To stay the same
He calls me small
Above every monster
Check your cupboard
My first kiss
Turning blue
Where I go after my windup
A big jam
Push me through
It ain't wrong
Never smiled
End my life
The only other thing I can do
Here we go
Moving slow
And then it’s back
Say he’ll come across
Here I’m going to live again
To claim the world
Know you’ll call
Who wants love from their lips?
Oh, and someone’s been caught up
On the bus
Just follow my heart
I’ve got all the wind in my sails
Adrift
Through the crying sun
Higher with the sun
Very violent
Where the trail leads to…
The voice leads me to leave
And I’m sorry it felt so good
It’s time to go home
The sleep of the subway
Eyes open and pure and what is there of me
Everyday I’m a lonely one
Tried to be trash
When it rains
The craziest car or windmill
Dirty until I clear my secret
Open your heart to them
The floor has fallen
To linger here for another generation
The sky does not care
He has no need for words
Move the needle here
Hey look at it
As I fell asleep
Forget your wands
Do you know where we’ll be tomorrow?
I won't feel good
A place where you love me
Love is dead
All I want is for you to die
Here we come to swallow
I used to tell her so
I'm feeling so fucking hungry
Somewhere that I can’t catch
Shut your mouth
Wouldn't you be happy?
She’s pretty
I'm not crying
In the minds of the law
I ’m driving away from you
With your money
No more this burnin'
Someone I can see and speak
With a nickel to the dollar
And here it is
I will see
Your world is just a piece of stone
He always looked at me, made me watch
Drawn a picture
Let's get to life
I know you’re me
From now on
No solace
Long live, I’m one
Crashing apart in my body
My angels adore me
Bully of civil liberty
Won’t forget
My life is good
Celebrate the hopelessness
Making my way through the crowd
He once gave it everything
Calling him a monster
Spinning flowers
I’m very sad
A prince of sunshine
Secret and private
Said fucking songs
That's not good for you
Waiting for one of these worlds
The passing riot cop
And cold blood leads to poverty
A thousand nights in love
Hurt you
Turn around in my mind
Baby your little tail
Upstairs
Into it
The big picture
You’re not real
Why didn't you just move my arm?
Hold your hand
I’ll be okay
Well let me just say
Smells like piss
Think
Around the town
Cover your ears
Join the dance
Set your mind free
A green beauty from cold
All the waves I drag
A lonely way
Rude white tent
Take it with you
Underneath my hair
May come if you need me
About an hour ago
Holy it’s not holy it's clean’s straight
Speed is high
Enter
Spinning stars
Coloring there
Dogeared on the shore
These are times I want
Drive’s filled
Can you reach the gate?
Blow your dreams
What do we mean by saying we don't care?
Of all times
Intense emotion
Asking him to get home
Look at this frail creature
Take some time right now
The shuffling shadows
In white?
Honey, yes
I want you to be my friend
Stop and stare
Burned from the crown
Take hold
Lost little worlds
Seen it through my eyes
Slip Away
Up here
Foundered
Right before his mind can rise
The word wins
The illusionism of love
They’ve got the time to get locked in
Unlike life
Cast your biggest test
I say to myself that we’re all friends
I don’t know who I’m gonna belong to
Pouring into the future
And today
You seem very different
Made me the enemy
All of this is for me
Go by my memory
Bloodlines in my veins
Wishing you new lives
Fallen in love
Started him dancing
Most important to him
That’s all she got
Boogie man, what a mess
The resistance slowly opens in
Modern kiss
What am I to know
Who’s standing?
Click on a wall
I feel you’re in danger
Put the gun down
Finders only deep inside yourself
When we became poor
And if you were
Smell my blood
Blood-drenched things
Lady of the seven seas
The sun rest in my eyes
Don’t lose sight of what we all stand on
Check out the snow
I got some pretty sick cutie mark
Just looking for you
What color flowers sing
Someone reminds me
Eyes wide and tired
That you came into sight of none
Behind the curtain
A trip to the seas
The midnight softness
He’s a lifeline
Starlight begins to stream from windows
Down with sun
Do you need it?
A young, sharp-eyed boy
Night in shining skies
Stranglehold upon history
Just make it known
Road to paradise
To have your hand
Before your hands glide
New planes
Time to climb up the bunk
Beautiful and moving
Situated in his body
Light that hangs in the ceiling
Different strands of meat
That means nothing to you
You’ve got nothing to lose
Cover your eyes
I’ll be alive every day
What you spent your time doing
While my flesh’s cracked
Little red hills
Elevate a stage
With somebody else
Love you and hate you
Throw the wind in your face
Leave behind that rotten day
Between the rock-solid blocks
She still beats it
Falling in love
Good to get a kiss
Where all the Christian money went
Dancing around like it’s forever
Stare at me
Colours change direction
Last
Swallow the bones
Your voice notes
Far apart
They got right under your nose
Brand new blood
Why else can't you sleep?
Until last time
We could die alone
No changes made
Into the jungle
Doppelganger
Crashes his face
I’m torn
Gully
They made love
So I do it with everybody
Life - all you had but one floor
With all that I see
They say, watch out for me
Low paying job
Gazing down as I go
When this clock goes off
Back of the tongue
Born to kill
I'll get into it with a beat
Perfect knowing
Let's put you in this body
I’m’d be satisfied
Turn inside out
The corrupt think I did
Putting you on our side
That's not fair
This is my me
Without God
But you’ll show
Nowhere to hide
Violent act
Another city to call
Hoping for our sun to shine
If you scream and cry as I say
This place is not what it used to be
Taking his dream name
Your hatred so light
Soul Encryption
The obvious truth
He just finished painting
Stumbling on sand
Blaming your boss
Know where to go
Cause this alone
I've lost all respect for you
Marching inside of our dreams
He seems satisfied
Yeah I’m talking to the bells
Watching him tremble
Yeah, come on for a ride
More to come
I want her lovingly taken away
My heaven
Rolling pictures
Surrender to what you mean
Too tired to feel
Staring at the wall
A shot through
Your use and reproach
He’s already been wrong
Like he said
I walked away
Back in the day
We turn down his cow
Never can forget my past
Down here
Change me
Take my mistress
Far in the future
Pretty white hands
Scour her rubble
After all the rain
The cold comes now
Can't see you again
It’s time for the stable
Upcoming justice
The golden earth
Flashing out the doors
Thought he had seen
Lonely are the lights of the earth
Let me go wild
When you gotta push it to the ground
Hightime has arrived
Still quite rude
Voting for Colgate
My illusions win
Kill the typhoon
The information you fed up
Flash light
And we knew
Begging for him
Isn't she going to make it this way?
Without getting into this deep silence
The casket and the veil
You’ll always be a part of my mind
Broke the door
Blood is the light
Beyond the street
Wherever the fun's been brought
Will pass that time
When you’re inside
Take my foot off the floor
The air cannot find its way into you
The power, the control you get
You’ll be making my heart full of nails
Wake me up
Forget any pleasure
What you’re doing
In the present
And for you
Getting out of the way
Your plan is only to kill a warning
To take a leap
Hell isn't my soul
Of fucking time
Hurry and pick away
Watching in the distance
No more frequent trails
The dreams of Alice
Shadows are falling
I want to be golden
You’re a bruiser
Someone’s just coming by
Inside the box
Something badly torn apart
Filled with milk
The moon of truth
Move your feet
Out in the plain
I am awake
Ride a mite
Gossip
Where you are’re standing
To speak truthfully
Push to replace the snow
Buried inside hell
Every minute
Drink all you want
I’m home
Golden towers
I care about you
We will face each other
Deep inside tonight
You know that you know
More than you can take
I saw a book’s starting to come out
You’ve got a time there
Above my crescendo
Locked up all night
Sell our souls
I’m getting jealous
She's wearing a handbag
Watcher of life
A hurricane's gonna catch up
Every wave of the sun
It’s an acrid day
On your side
Bring it for me
Forever will be
Die more slowly
Called for help
To be free
And they tell me
Sealed on rocks
Dreaming of savagery
I’m alive in front of the mirror
As much pleasure as I can get
Chasing the moon
Raging mad in church
I cannot write this goodbye
Without thinking
I didn't know what it was
Friends on the flowers
And so I’ve got this squinted eye
Clear the sky
Mine ends with him
Wet o' dust
Made you cry
Your tears start falling
Place on your garden floor
Decent way to go
Driving on the earth
Looking back in the dark
Grew up
To defend the holy plant
Born from the prison we broke
It’s boring
This town in the sky
Last, glorious and holy
At the best job
You’re floating
A mountain of dead apples
You gotta go away
We are part of another rainbow
She may have gone a little too far
Dry spell
Put the phone down
You go out in high school
That's my house
Here comes the last story
Cominning-glass
Erasing bloodlines
Things I cannot see
This is all I have to say
Death does fear you
Go head to head
No one can sit on the ground
Your understanding is frightful
Anyway to keep things a secret
Makeup white
You’re supposed to be a sorrowful artist
Bring your future before me
The emptiness fades away
Can you find an ad?
Live your life safely
Search for a chance
Called her name
Crying and weeping for the cross
Somebody I don't know
Blood on the chalkboard
Of anger and sorrow
But there ain't room to move
A vision
Nothing good to say
She was waiting for you
Touch your skin
A mental question
Stay around me
Slipping the film
The city up and down
Visions of broken hearts
A summerie doll
Walked past eyes
The page of paper
You kept trying to kill me
I cannot wait to find out what you say
The reason I fell
I'm hearing your voice
Pictures of my sickles
Accept this favor
We really fucked up
Prevent himself from killing you
Why isn't anyone doing it?
We have good eyes
Why can't you sleep at home
It’s time for the great game
Millions’s worth of money
Under the shadow
The center of the house
Own the soul
We are like a fake
Shut up and move
About wanting to kiss something
People don’t know
We created him
Fully blurred vision
Give you the hook
Stand up, drag me away
The shoes you’ll be wearing
She walks down the hall
Shadow of something I see
Too many people
Locked inside a cell
Wonderful stage
The beaming moon
Bound down and dead
The walls shut
Of no sentimental place
Right to the ocean
Her beauty
He
He rides away
Suffering pain
The black space
I’m not looking through the day
To relieve herself
I feel sick
Took care of me
I’ve spent the last century stranded alone
Tomorrow
I used to stay out of sight
You’ve been here for so long
Starting to throw up
Man’s got an oneness
You’re gonna hate yourself
Where the music stops
Ask that boy why
I just wanna sleep
There’s nothing to make of it
You’re here to stay
Big picture
Behind a black curtain
Take your time
Wouldn't it be funny if he’s loved again
Dying alone
From this knife to your feet
Born on this paper
Kill me in your hand
Feel free to eat
Let's talk rainbows
You have my heart
Maybe you’re giving up
Riding out the lights
Determination is my strength
The miracle of liberty
I can never be good
Like I’m a trap
Fake stories
And then I died
Keeps you free
In my opinion
Place in my face
Money's gonna fade away
The star on the staircase
And this time you are
I’ll get you something
All over the whole city
Speed miles
Fooled or pleased
I’ll show you what it means
But we still have a little to do
You’ll never find the word
Life on the line
The desert's boring
Today I know what you’re feeling
Let me just have a moment
Until the beast dies
I don’t see that coming
It's pretty too good to be true
Stars for their stars
Like tomorrow
That never happens
To think of you
Is he free?
Using your mercy
Anything you need to do
Hey, nice view
Waiting for a kick in the ears
A pair of sunglasses
That he was lonely
My body’s almost alive
If you’re still all alive
Just follow your dreams
Life is old and cold
Hurt a girl
Looks like you
Through a vein
True in Hollywood
It's fucking violent
Two bright years
The music of the sea
Dirt tracks
Run down the stage
And she had to change places
Push your legs down
Everybody in the town
If you want a slice of the night
Down with the split china
Try to keep me warm
No emotion
Sunlit blues and shining amber
I gotta finish him
When I was gonna cry
Makes me sad
Stoked the passion
I do…
Travel
We will ride it out
I thought you were
The only human I know
It’s some nostalgia joke
The clouds of the dawn
Build a new life
Seems very weird
Give me my gun
When I say I was pleased
Put together a song
Yeah, okay
Flying to America
You’re coming home
A train of fire
From corruption and red flags
Touch me with that lousy guitar
Love is like an old brother
I won’t cry out
Smell the message
It is broken
Send me off to lie
What about me?
Won't lose her sweet face
Leave me or I shall become a law
Tired of keeping the innocent silent
Recess and dance
I thought it was Jesus
I’ve been dead forever
Closest place to a burning bush
A scarlet kiss
Trapped and stuck
Wrangling a chorus
See what they say
Face in a bottle
With a ball of fur
Scaled in splendor
Fall off the planet
Down in the basement
I’m out of everything
Dead men breathe
Slap your hand away
So beat the train
Don’t be afraid to call me
Candy
You’re called light
Seems like an attack by one
Who’s a giant?
Ousiss the days
I see a silver lining
Just what she got
Bewildered
Nothing for me
Never come anymore
I say, I want to know
Overventurous wet and cloudy
Hell and all’s fair
Trapping together
Yes... we’ve got no success
Or at least some imagination
A thousand pages of a smooth head
Deep dreams are held
The pitiful smith
Sometime you’ll know
I’ve got a special girl
I’m dying of envy
I’ve seen way too much
Like I should be
Where the crying is
A shield
Ask the others
Among your shattered teeth
Find your things
Seeing an open wound
No need to ride the sword
Talking to her
Selling the body of a woman
Goodbye winter
Look out for me
And say how men are nice
How could I possibly be apart
All over
The speed of our dreams
I just can't fucking do it
My relationship as you grow up
When we’re all together
You belong in my store
As I walk the highway
Right now you are still smiling
I tell you
No, what happened?
In the thick of the day
Just me
My laughter and dream
Hello
Doesn't matter who wins
High in the morning
Throw a ball down
A different ending
I’m the same
Such an easy target
The dream is eternal
We danced a little differently
Selling the romance
One slice of history
Somebody’s gonna get shot
Flown away by one sick old cannibal
Love that the ground changes colors
Your mother promised me death
I can’t wait till he’s gone
But just within the next two minutes
Got paper and a cup of tea
It's gonna stay with you
Lead out the windows
You can believe it's happening
You’re inside
Life being nothing but service
Good cop till the start
Play in your music
You make it hard for me
I started out as you do
This new flag
The sparkles of affection
Time to dance
Think of what you’ve been through
Lovable silver inside you
Rather be a mountain
While crying
Cast her memories in your heart
You keep dying
A fine instrument
Take that on train
Sounds like tomorrow
Obsolete canvas
Twelve miles down the highway
If I die tomorrow
Every thing
Half of my living room
We parted like a wave
For what’s good
Hang it around
In the only space between men
Most of the time, it’s your fault
Things seem fine
It’s getting late
The grass grow red
A place of amusement
His mouth is empty
Patterns of sparks
Act at the same time
All right now
You’re going to send me inside
Just watched your life changing
Never feel
They see me
Nothing says we love
Paddling outside
Walking down the dark path
Sing by the the lonesome
Pretend you met me
We did it together
That game
Love opens new doors
You mean it’s you?
Sleeping all over me
Jesus said
While the sun's shining
To burn and drown
That damn devil
Big bitch
Here I go again
Before that floor
In such a big way
The way you come
I’m standing inside
Don’t stay
My victim’s guilt
Can go to heaven
Time is on your side
Thank you
The midnight love
I never knew him
She wore clothes of silver
Wherever I could be
Care for your money
Back to some strange place
I never gave you a chance
The sparks go from inside your heart
Are you with me?
Lucky you
I keep your hand so close
Was born just to be alone
Great house
Morning is coming
A rifle in your hand
And you know
Saw you bleed my love
Their nuts and bolts
A game of mirrors
And the soundtrack to gangsta rap
All talk of flying
They started a chain reaction
When someone else brings you money
Learn some American history
Where I live
Our lives turned
When I’m doing it right
It’s all about fear
So long ago
We've left here
Up the route
Feel for something
Your lives don’t seem all that different
Really bad mistake
Turning our back on you
Light up the pages
You won’t be so lonely
Where I don’t wish you knew
The true, a shadowlike thing
Another time
Downstairs, upstairs
You can see that past
For three days
It’s almost endless
Join me in his arms
Little sensation
So let's just be friends
Have you ever met a golden girl?
To burn by me
Love reminds us
Becomes all gone
She’s the lover
The moment is here
You’re not an idiot
I should get some friends in my band
Great western smoke
Waking up to a vision
Learn to survive
What is this place called?
A feeling that this was gonna last
To find out what you mean
My dreams are fighting
Sit back and allow me
Hello real life
The monster broke the peace
Got no trouble
And I know it’s coming
I will ruin this music
Go away
Hiding behind our hopes
Vain to lose
That you’ll know soon
Grown apart
Shader
When I’m around
Jesus would go
Straight into the abyss
Oh my god I’m awake
Intergalactic relations
Yeah, it’s easy to be lazy
Take it away
How to survive on acid
I’ll need you to be
Just one more chance to turn
Tell me a new name
In the high air
I’m mine
But about tomorrow
I want the world to know
I used to hang around here
When the butterfly sat down
You’re the reason I had to move in
Stand up and shake my hand
Long golden days
No one dies for nothing
Wherein I hide?
I'm watching my lover sleep
Back in the ways
Johnny
All through eternity
And I ’ve got no shame
All of you
Life is small
Into this world
Slip through the cracks
Son, you missed that
And now I feel something good
Hold down that pistol
Hard more like hell
Rain and shine
The last place to hide
Grab your heart
Son of every man
The art of the chase
I’ll never look my best again
Obtainments of murder
You won't give me money
Can’t stay neutral
I mean all of us
I died
Make a new fucking world
Waking in their quiet
Upending the romance
The false, polluted water
You must quit right now
Nobody cares
The moon leads me to sleep
Tomorrow ’s the party time
Different love
Finding my own destiny
That famous shine
Tired of me seeing you
When I say goodbye
Can you even put on that monologue
I say I can put away all that sadness
I loved you
And I didn’t know
Meet the sun
Yeah okay I need to be fast
Snail with the vines
Be quiet and dream
Dump me’s head
We saw him crying
Beyond this poem
Your protection is indecent
Carefully and gently
Take their art-loving souls
Makes you feel comfortable
On my doorstep
Make a friendly peace
Don’t have to feel bad about it
Calling for it
My view
When the sun shines
I keep going
I knew she was mine
I don’t want to be your friend
Put down your bridge
Some people don’t give a damn
My sorrow changes
Can’t do it anymore
I feel I’m doomed
Old virgins are getting older
Begging for gold
I’m a busybody
I could get tired
Silence still shines
It’s been going on forever
A tree I ride
Put your brain to work
In an all-inclusive chapter
I think he’ll tell me
City control
Flying on the horizon
Crude price
In tears
Stupid old fool
Sick at heart
Like your mind is me
I’m a walking dead
Where my brother never seen
I’m here so suddenly
Some people think they've never met
Same old hopeless talk
I know, I love you
The day of your death
I went home
I wanna feel okay
Tonight I love
The new seven stars
So you'll be here?
When I finally got one
Iron food
Little ironic kid
Make me crazy
Concoct one thing and pass it off as art
Say so little
Your make it shine
Walk by my window
Where did you go
Where the moon
In another world
Run on the moon
Ever keep on keeping up
Looking for your side
I don’t look pretty
Flying dreams
Things that may or may not survive
Dancing a fine tune
In love with a person
Staring down on the wall
You took control
Jump over to the people
No way that I’m supposed to be
I remember this dream
Iron hangs on shelves
You know why
Wall of death
Vomiting white and red
Hooligans love me
From street to gate
They brought your food
Things we knew
Used her fingers
You know you’re in for a ride
A star of Babylon
Time to commit suicide
Lost all my nerve
And get inside your body
I missed you
Go to heaven
Feeling your feet running
Freakin' everybody he meets
Lose me
I’m always late
When didn’t you hear?
Around the clock
A lifetime of loneliness
What really matters is today
To come to you
Where dreams come true
Pouring our blood into the storm
You’re not supposed to hear
Don’t hurt me
Selling everybody
All the new language
Noisy love
Rude, jealous, and expensive
The lights up
During the offseason
The guards say no
High above all
Couldn't have done this
Love the book
Just another day
If anyone did
I’ll cry out loud
Make your mind a hundred shapes
Cold steel
Calling to his face
Chasing you
The bitter sting of defeat
It’s a kind of beast
Let's reach for their dead
Long distance train ride
He’s had enough of hatred
I grew too old
Hanging over the pavement
That was my weak spot
Better hear me now
His false bravado
You know what
I’ll have to be a liar
I’m locked in
Search the south
Deep sleep
Every bit of it
Right now you go
Say it ain't for me
Memory aches
Who’s got no fight left
Broken stetship
Another years from now
Ready for your wrath
If you don’t want to take advantage
He said tomorrow, yeah?
I don’t need it’s alright
The call's out
A single and innocent hero
Ride through the night
Money’s seen
You look like you, or you don't come close
I love you so much
And now you are
Got a lie
Sick of your lies
A sickness of flesh
That feels like a lifetime
You are always crying
Yes, please don’t let me down
And I made a mistake
Things you can say
You’ll like this
Staying inside your mind
I see no enemy
Laughing over all the problems
A lonely bag
Bad falls in love
Old and new releases
I don’t care where it’s headed
An untold story
Made through a mountain
I mean my name is again
Stay true to yourselves
Silverfish waves
Have got a plan
Please don’t make me a cliché
You meet another human?
Turning clear and tidy
She’s got more than meets the eye
Tired of the others
Don't turn me down
The cold is your hard fact
Or scared
You’re not asking for anything
My karma is my isolation
Dance out your exclamation
Still goons getting away
Freedom to act like I'm in a mine
Lay the bag
Good heavens
Every friend of mine
Sailboat airfare
Then there's nothing anymore
Blame you
If the cloud
Shooting from here
I can be an old man
Make a matter of it
We should leave a trail
Go through with you
I can look and feel
You’re gotta help me
Jesus' wheel that turns purple
The world’s a mad place
Wasn't right here
No control in the skies
Won't move the shame
I'm not even comfortable
Time has run out
The sentiment has kept me going
With most people
Make your own yellow people
Stepping on the hard shore
Yes to call you so
Please knock the sidewalk
If you think you are
To get rid of your faults
Through the window
Waiting for something
The walls of your head
Can you see?
Your ears call
The class that is in charge
But there's no such thing
Our youth say no
Something changes
Looking at you on a dark and rainy night
Calm the sky
What a pit of beasts
Cover the storm
I’ve spent my life crying
Feel myself afraid
The only ones who like to talk
In true dance
I have been dying for so long
This is a spiritual grieve
My baby's broken
I still don’t have the holy order
Where the future leads
The sound of these endless train wrecks
You’re all in my eyes
It's not…it’s not right
The everyman
People will get upset
Really?
Ashes my soul
And I know what they do
I guess they had a clue
Across the ocean
Your soul won’t be long
Took my eyes off of me
Your teeth could hurt
A nine-year old living with demons
You're just gonna wake up next door
Sixty thousand little things
Nobody’s hired me
Leave it there
The two ways
Got a free ring
Taking me with you
Hurt
You cannot believe it
And in the next revolution
Walking out onto your town
One ballcap
Behind all the stars
In glory
Giving it everything
Do something like that
Don't be so impatient
Blackbird blue
Money is so dangerous
Your choice
Wipe me from my soul
Can see right through it
My mother is talking to me
Make my boy question
I can tell him shit
While you were watching
She wasn't fucking going home
The tears flowed
Is it for you?
Mother of the Lord
Severely fucked
You knew I’m coming to stop
Pissing how low it can go
You are so tired
No shame
It’s easy to roll in love
He’s around
Just I know
First time of summer
Precious little trick
The pain is over
There's lots of other people
Lying silent
The caretaker of what was
Move the men
I found somebody safe
The broken laws
Alone in awe
Long hair’s a decent route
Damage that fades and more
That card will come out on top
Punch for the balls
In the time when I was unearthly
It makes me so lonely
You don’t know what’s wrong
Wake up your mouth
You can call me seductive
I'm a shame
Everybody’s wondering?
Diving in title: While I grow older
Young chums
You see the fruit of my sweat
She built me the statues
Any clues you've found
A photo on the wall
Any life is a story
Used a spoon
Took advantage
You have to be brave
The river whirls around me
Walking around inside me
To live in ruins
While the wind blows
Throwing wreaths
Baby wants to move out of me
Fly to stars
That as she sees it
I’m glad they’re gone
Through the stars
Deep within you
Secret store of things
Pray she was your idol
Scaled down
Had a dream
I saw you get ready
The stone bone jaw
Don’t make any mistakes
That is what life’s all about
A twenty-five hour rampage
Ride that bus
Higher-priority love
Found these bags
Out of style
To get close
Died for the time
Trapped in that silent place
Didn’t know
What I cannot help you
Got all the demons
I'm close to dying
On my mantelpiece
A simple human death
Every time I do
Busted
You have just done it
Laugh and roll
The mirrors and the flowers
Weaving stream of sound
What I know
Reminds you why
Go back, I'm the rain king
The help one needs
And come back the other way
The old superstition
We are my own creation
But I have no one around
Life is full of deeds
In your stomach
A rock at the side of the road
Act of war
All the stones follow you
Lucky guy
On top of the mass slaughter
Mistake, mistreat
A knot in my throat
I’m getting close
Green fire
That and the freedom
Talk about going to heaven
Preacher
The things I try to make
In the game of life
Curtain spouts
Think a little more
Where we want to be
Singing and loving
Heady little kids
Whose love’s been lost
Snakes breathe
I’m got a vision
I’m feeling tired
Will you keep eating through me?
We all have our minds on us
If you could all pass
It makes my skin feel warm
His mind went crazy
I’ll find out
Your hard-earned cash
That was true
To Tender the sweet couch
Whenever I was young
Flailing
Put a grin on your face
Thanks for your help
I think that could be cool
And you just want to wake
Just listening to her
Push me by my feet
Wash it away
That night
I see you instead
My love comes from behind
Dirt on the ground
Wild creatures afraid
Burn the papers
People who lose their mind
White as silk
Underneath the sky
Kissing sky
Just after me
Broken chords
Blue dresses
My heart plays the same tune
Then we both hear
But your suit is leather
I’ll just ask why
Right for the moment
When I met you
I keep getting pleasure
The world is melting
Sun and distant nights
Join in my dance
Next to nothing
You’ve spent your life stuck behind
Through my soul
They looked at you with cold hatred
Good mornings
Satisfied I don’t cry
I’m not crying
They need you
Your vision will be violent
There is no avoiding this place
Just broken up like shit
You’ve no remedy
Don't change a thing
The way she talked
The sun in my eyes
A brighter future
Speak plainly
Take her on her walk
You’ll be here someday
Rock up the sky
I can’t let you go
And now come and go
Stepping over everything
Let us be
And you can’t win
A sea wave
We see the same concept
Burn to ashes
Living through misery
Got the weed up your arm
Degenerative wealth
I’m busy getting here
Take no prisoners
I don’t want to stay here
Her custom guy
Think it all worth it
The heart of life
The silhouette of something good
Two children keeping their faces up
In the dark
Stop fucking around
I will be you
Suddenly
When the breasts’re gone
Gentlemens
To make thee tremble
Across a river
You won’t lose your soul
It's so hard
What will you do?
Took my picture
On my mind
You’ll never catch me
You can’t help it’s so blank
Stop playing with diamonds
The news you've got locked down
His look was fatal
You say
Here you are
Isn't the only thing that matters
In your place
Where the country lies
White pearl tint
The faithful get away
To reach the great father
Nothing to lose
Right now to reach him
You could be mine
Just out of fear
There are my pictures
Or something
Too much honey
The image that you have to be
Hide your braiding
That's why we all die
Rather than preach
The saints will sing at the floor
I want you there
Your sex is so messed up
I don’t have my future
See, the night is fading
Save my life
That gets across the finish line
Moving through time
Don’t look at me like that
Paperback edition
Caught on video
That doesn’t matter now
We have known each other for years
It's like leaving you alone
I'd never lose it
Hello for a date
That may be the end
Little brain
Scaring off every morning
Bring me not so easily
I think I am
Ten grand
You can do my thing
Going south
More bear song
The world is turned upside down
Neon sneakers
The ones who watch
Wall of a bottle
The lie
Rock on his head
Naughty
For the Italian goldfish
She’ll not say
I am wondering
Same boat song
Happy drinking
That being so sure
Every dream is a nightmare
It’s so easy
Yes
The hatred you’re so afraid
Nobody should hear it
Don’t hold your breath
Down down your arm
Peek through a cloud
Still strive
And he’ll try to dance
Wake in the middle of the night
To take a knife edge
I can hold my own
Slow in your career
Where those pictures are taken
Didn't change
Made fun of me
Im a idiot
Plastic spoon
You used to be happy
Years without fireworks
Friendship will fail
Has to push it in
Stand up, out loud
What a lie
Friends with a free mind
With sorrows of everlasting fire
So clearly she has no voice
Maybe you see me today
Paint me black
Hello darling
And you're watching
Call me weak
But here I am
That day was unreal
The whole place is quiet
I should try
We shall bring our own children
Now that you see me
Watching the future
Smashed eyes
Time for the day
Wish I hadn't been here
Make peace with your enemies
Your silhouette walks down the road
My first love
Every penny
Meet the ghosts
Wound up
You’re looking at the road
Asleep’s ready to be asleep
Mise ruffle your feathers
I’m not all wrong
Tired of being a son
Needn't cry at all
So far gone you are
This is right before your eyes
Swing close to my house
Love me this much
From just another substitute
Something I hate
A human hand
Search for heaven
Such a sad mood
We won't be together
From hell
Disciples of the fiery skies
Utter word of the Crown
You know what you feel
Climbing into the sky
Tell your story
To almost smile
Remembering who
Hurt all the time
Wherever you come from
High and mighty
Becomes hot
Little girl
So clearly out
Full of passion
Punch through every roulette wheel
Hate so many things
Dancing with the devil
Everybody else will want to catch up
Saying I'm gonna do it if you wanna
Abandoning everything
Song for a night
In the fields
Sail down the waves
Save your life
Panic of vengeance
Sitting down
Come down to the fiery sea
Don’t need my help
The running star
Reading a letter in a jar
Now I see you already
He was taking notes
No more neon cars
Falling down
The money will be paid
We
Trying to lie
Burn again
Behind the iron bars
But the sky
Knife through my stomach
Just to tell
Too fucked up for you
Any chance you can get
This feels a bit like big light
Blow the whistle
Skinny as a whip
With low hopes
To where they go wrong
She thinks she’s a prophet
Do you see me?
You see how far we get
An eternally cool morning
I need you’ve built me a secret dream
Don’t try to get away
Are you hurting me?
See you soon
The statue wall
My sadness
I’m not doing it for her
I gotta say that
Uninvited
To stay alive
Stupid ladies and men
Ride against the cloud
Sipping blood
You live at peace with a fool
Stealing time
Go on a date
Sweet parade past
My great-great-great grandfather
Long daylight
Bought me a lifetime
Until her grandpa found her
Moon from the sky
Drowned in cold water
Lost the line
I’m supposed to find you
Down with all the noise
To say the wildest thing to someone
Nothing so true
This is a fickle thing
Turning the weight of my concerns
While I wait for the month to come
Drop the Candy
Heard the sound of my footsteps
Love is a poison
Hate came my way
It’s what I’ve been through
That leaves the other side alight
It will bring out the devil
I will beat you on the ass
I say don't keep out
Blow around for fun
The flight of a frog
Are you so cold?
I feel scarred
Sit down and sing
The lyrics to all the things I had to say
Until they show up
Got no known room
Let's take the earth
It’s just me
Colors changing
Four winds, seven sides
No shelter
A private place you see before
The last question
Supposed to stop
Shake your pretty hearts
I’ll give you something
As beautiful as your promises
One last minute fade
You did the right thing
Like a miracle
Take my sweet piss
Getting laid
How can you care?
The reason I said sorry
Tears just flow
Can't hear me do it
Life can play a role in my destiny
I’m getting colder
Tired of it all
Don’t believe in me
We just gotta get to our friends
Harsh with empathy
Lucky for you
Darkness inside
In shackled words
Committed suicide
Though time might have turned
You’re my old darlings
Here she comes
Move past that moment
Bodies run high
We’ll be crying
The ship that sent you
To hide the truth
Her eyes turned green
Here's your girl
Try to make it’s nice
Floating island
It was written in sorrow
Black virgin, naked star
Wrongs of the city
Talking to him
Her roots are planted
Back my dreams
Love in your bones
Touch me, please
So I thought
Your shadow opens your eyes
This the last time
Paper or ink tricks
I’m impatient
I use my voice
Lost another girl
I don't like this
That leads me to the part
Hound her
Live for him
I turned up to meet you
Another trick
Beyond the exile
Let it be
Waiting for your hollow
Sometimes you walk into a riddle
Running around staring
Caught up in a spinning haze
The lonesome night
I can see my guard out
The last line
Know who cares
Moving through cold water
The fury of a mosquito
Such a silly title
The power you gave
There ain't much to lose
Horses roll around on a bed
Whatever you have received
Silence now
Here comes your big brother
With wings on your legs
Getting through all the pressure
Wherever you wanna be
Good night to you
With my lust and my love
Know every stitch
God’s sweet only within walls
It’s your record
Get naked so naked
In the interest of playing along
Oh, they won
Where will she go?
Hold it close
Keep on running
That's it’s really there
I need to close the window
Got hold of him
Cold hearted heart
I’ll find you
Sometimes I'll be getting a clue
Her band
That smile’s what you pay us to do
I don't know why you’ve done it?
But if you’re right
An order to you
Grab up and wander
Very strange blue
No one’s watching
These trails to meet
The camel lumps my coat
Spending all day together
My pride is built
Reading’s like leaving the house
Now hear me out
Your success
The cage-eating bear
Everything I got
No matter what we do
I use a coffin
Memories light up your thoughts
Beneath the branches
Run up a dollar or two
You’re here to pay the rent
So start fucking around
Which is why I want you
I think I'm gonna be okay
Some of it falls apart
Buried by a falling star
Made of steel
Join me today
Leaves the cut
Open with a smile
The noise made me sick
You say you want it too
The coldest day
Down in your own world
Flying by a thousand sticks
Come in the wind
Don’t treat me like something else
That nobody left to buy
Without us
Taking comfort
Great scale
Only fits your ear
New bus trips every night
Let's not forget that
Sick of this rush
Don’t waltz out
And so she let him down
Search for the death’s ticket
Mister me today
Sorry to disappoint you
It’s cold here
Hey watch the singing
A search for the spine
I just want to watch the streetlights shift
More than a horse
About lost years
My drinking game
Thrice your wealth
I just live in a bubble
Blue mountain way
The fan
Doing your best to please
Swipe lefty trick
My friend and I are going
My life is too lonely
This ancient cannibal killer
Good for posterity
Though that all comes crashing down
Enduring every terror
Playing clockwork
We laid flowers
Blocked their throats
It’s not like that’s right
With notes written down
Exclaiming ourselves
Dreams and dream visions
How could I possibly know
The blue park
No crimes on record
Place your hand on my forehead
You lost us
Can’t you feel the pressure
Sit for a minute
Even as I'm dying
Let the news stand
The poet could hate me
Pick up a woman
Move on
Reminds me of a world I made in bed
Saves me a hell of a future
Ragged and savage
The suffocating soul
These questions have no answers
A scarlet mess
Broke in your jail
Don’t dream of this
Reading my lips
You’re standing here tonight
From our balconies
Cute dust
You can’t think of another name
You don't want to go alone
You're gonna hit the ground running
Nothing bad will come of it
I died for you
You gotta think good of me
Just roll over to sleep
Interlude after another day
I thought it was poison
The horse's gonna die
Money I can take
Perfect plan
Seeing from over that line
When I could live
The power of the devil
Literal shit
Flashing through the streets
You and me in the street
Just leaves the future unlocked
With our support
Kissed into my cheek
Leave me to meet your ladies
Big and powerful
Getting up right now
A sorrowful world
A hatred so powerful
Hey rain on fire
Amongst the dead in solitude
Just hang out and have fun
I’m okay with it
Time passed
Watch your heart skip a beat
Preying on you
Im not sure who to look for
They gave up on their low hopes
Feeling sick
Can I reach you inside?
You’re a one of them
Take to the cross
Distant I guess
The grass colour’s dry
I am a broken statue
Ready to spit your bread
What you expect
A wizard’s prison
Destroy your enemy
She’s getting thin
In the evening
Meet me inside the game
Been a long time ago
She's looking for me
And now it’s time to say goodbye
Where's my ass?
An Indian sorcerer
Pits of living
Pull the trigger
Walk in the stars
Dying now
Under the shadows
Swing by my station
I can feel this tension
Son of honey
Didn't you notice me?
Sit like a diamond
You’re telling me everything
When they’re long gone
Been awhile since you started
Please let me know
Put your hammer back on your head
Many years ago
My name is tense
She's at the punch line
Live for a moment
A young man just to give
Put on the neon blue
Midnight watching moon
No address
That hurts right now
Loving a miracle
And she saw the master once again
I see through your window
I don’t know
Watching the same old movie
We are yours
I will pass away
Mother couldn’t help but cry
This is the sunshine
Memories come to life
With some surprise
Convinced I couldn’t look on
Care to feel your own?
For nothing
A lethal mist
While nowhere to hide
Wash away the ashes
And what can I do?
Do it together
Stealing my wings
Talk about a dream
When you are all gone
Live in harmony
We are running out
Every time
Blood and lava
Made an ancient image
With the drug’s punishment
Hold on tight alrightie’s right
Come on sweetie
They’re probably watching
Black porcelain and plumage
I fought like a devil
Forever’s mine
Your eyes never match
Baby you’re at least kidding?
Sounds so simple
Forget about a dream
Check the roll of your eyes
Rising down the street
But you’re mine
Hard times
Life is just like your mind
Let me look at this
Mouthpiece of someone else
I’m floating down
Bending the world
Got a tan
Just pay more attention
To find something wrong
Yeah, we're friendly
Only try to let life be
Mister, start dressing down
Through the ruins
Going where no one else goes
Check to see who can show up
You’ll have it in you
I can feel you’re close to getting high
You can touch me
Then again, they are far apart
He wasn't a cop
The wedding ring
People are waking
Cut you off and drag your arms around
Rest in peace
Keep inside
Cleaned up shit
As you sleep
After all she fought for
Neon in the acid
With everything in her mind
Burning sun
Think and think again
Emotions are moving so fast
Hold it together
Unconstitutionally rude to others
Sealed in an ocean
Look through your eyes
I just need a teacher
Down with the outside world
The left lips are hard
I feel hurt and bitter
You've brought it from hell
Things I missed
Feel bad for her
The acrid nest of godless shadows
My brains won the ball game
The screen of death
Shiver in your memories
What we do
I did say that
Sad to see
My eye turned so big
Ready to take the blue
On the blind side
When did you get down here?
Miss you?
I get it
Let's face it
Devil for your money
The force of human beings
Anybody follow me?
Streetlights walk through
Take this place I’m going to
Bloodletting
Assemble the spark of a hurricane
Water to his heart
Made your bones like a trumpet
Watch how you roll my memory
Pieces of a puzzle
She’s just uptight
We’ll be moving in different directions
You see you’re here
Keep me in your house
There’s nothing like she
What began as a thousand hearts
Fly from one crisis to the next
We're not yet inside
More clues
I'm almost at the start
Every little thing
More than toys
I only see you once
You don't want to go home
He’s broken
The force comes in waves
Drink their vodka
Mistakes at all costs
Good for you
Your ground floor gangsta
Now so hot
I took you
All you can do
Don't bring us down
Keeps our feet wet
In it I came
Blood row
Give it to me
Forget all the shades
Seeing who you are
A fight between opposites
Walking in on my victim
I’m standing on the white corridor
With their hovels
Waiting for the sea
I feel like I’m being purged
Real
Great songs
Turn around and take it back
I’ll be fine and right
Above your hour
Heinz's lost his high
Check it out
A new all-time high
Watching TV
On my way out
Squeaking in the trough
Got to make my point
Just another day ahead
All the losers
Be free
I’m finally awake
All your suits
Looking at the things people do
Come for me
The whole world's gonna dance
We’re looking for it
Tonight
Inspiration, revelation
Learn how to play
Any damn time will tell me so
Stop leaving the country
Dancing together
Think you already know
Took you to supper
We broke with that law
The priest looks cool
Downright fun
With her shadow
Just about to swallow
You hear the bells day and night
Checking your goddamn day
Walk with me
Always gonna be like you
I’m coming so far
It's the Devil
Jesus invented the birth control pill
You and I get together everyday
Across this hill
I’m fine with the fleshy paper
We've been living within ourselves
Your rights look rusty
The only thing higher than winning
Unwrap the fire
If you meet me for love
I’m here
Crying in fear
My friends can't touch
Like you got confused
Everybody knows it’s the same
Anyway
Lie so tight
Please put your arms around me
It’s a little bit less than here
Love will send words
Every country in heaven
I got it going
Slow in order
The streetlife ghost of fame
Fly to your own memory
Watching my mother die
Waiting for another dream
A voice that will meet you
In a flash
By killing you
You’re going mad
The prize’s fine
Yes, yes, please
Blowing in my mouth
Screw you
My heart is your soul
Stand your ground
Getting the reins of power
To the dusty cemetery
Smells like dead meat
Hazing
You’ve got no words
He lives your loneliness
Long overdue redemption
Addicted to pixie dust
Lucky to have you in my life
Let us make a new world
I find myself working
I am here now
That other day
Those three towers
In this day and age
There’s no one to watch
Go down again
The way we know
The bottles fall off
We sold ourselves
One animal fainted
Long overdue
Say all the time
A drowsy little boy's job
To give you a look
Then she’s dead
A universal claim
Find out how to stop it
I'm a savior
Talking beautiful in your own eyes
Run me over
He's got to win for her
He's started to quit
If you cast me on the wings
Can I feel it now?
The pussy of guilt
As he closes his mouth
That appears like a lie
When we come home
Hide the pathetic lie
Cut down the trees
Storm through me
With the light of day
You told me
Send me my apologies
A punch in the arm
Talk about our eternal enemy
If you survive this phase
Every memory gets improved
Into an empty scene
The sewer dream
He hung around in his little town
Was it supposed to be about your lives?
She looked so little at the time
I’ve never seen your face
We're no longer dead
Asphyxiating my dreams
Enough is enough
The rule of law
Dreaming of changing my words
To sow sorrows
I do not know who you are
Aaaand all that wildness
I’m going to be so sick
Greatness you owe me
Quaking in the desert
To spark your skill
Yeah, I’ve got it called
All the praise
God damn you
Feel free to cuss
My broken heart
Live a life with me
I didn't dance
Got on his face
I’m taking over
Vomit me
Dismembering me
That said, your spirit
The clouds now cover me
I do not hate you
It's obvious
Coming from heaven
When I stop talking
Got some flowers to sell
To be an angel
I'd try to become Miss America
Nothing you can do
I think you have another hand
And I didn't know what I saw
Hair
Up and down
Easy to reach
We made money
Young and beautiful
Down in the pool
Great save for your soul
Fitted to live here
He's starting to quit
Watching the silver tongue
Return to the movie
It’s ridiculous
I’m the little boy
Stepping up your game
I saw the world
As we have died
That's what you see
Kitted out for You
Surrounding the windows
And you’re tired of it
Please have love
Hear me say
Take the heat
The beast and his language
Let a day pass
Waiting for the world to turn
Been taken by a spell
Take my place
Down with your filth
We are gone
I made a friend out
Two good times we could have known
You’ve never met
What the hell am I doing here?
I’ll burn your eyes
Gave you all my success
What isn't to fear?
Suddenly everyone inside
While you can’t look away
The dead priest
I can’t get used to my existence
Like a silver wheel
Smoking my song
Take your baby boy
Come here, knock on my door
Bring me down
Sitting with the devil
Brand new carpet
The hollow door
Long time same
Waiting for the truth
From the piece of me
Dig another hole
Laugh at that rock star
I’m once again wrong
The plan is to lose her
The bleak hole
The finest ships
I’ll see you when I grow up
Things start to piss you off
You’re not gonna let me sleep
Glass
The demons never lose to you
She’s not the whole story
Standing up for myself
The headless skeleton
I fear not
Strings and mirrors
Vanished from you
Comrade sheriff
We'll do it together
A beautiful view
Four empty blue pills
Take a shine to your face
Remember the love of his head
He loves her too
Squash up the emotion
The way to love
We got people
You look around the room
In the street
To see you
Know not who I am
No one is a guest
The vision
And sit without love
He can't lose anymore
You’ve all died
With a grin
No no one else
Before you were alive
A little boy gets their nights
Love is my life
Take a look at the picture
Disappoint me
Come on down
Is everybody crying?
Save me alone
With a boy
Everything breaks
Kinda suicidal
Your mom will make you laugh
I will be sorry
To break free
Move aside
Kill the memories
If she tried on his clothes
Are you going to be ok?
I can’t survive without you
I’ll never be satisfied
And kiss and weave
People flying around
Life is safe
The silver lining
Changing the wash
Blowing red to everyone
Arbours come all the way around
Have some excuses
He lost sight of the day
And smile like a girl
I keep my life to myself
He made me sick
Inside the dream
But I gotta have you
He’s a shock to behold
While she rakes in your money
But where do I go?
Now we’re doing it again
My younger brother
Sounds like shit
The life of living expression
The despair in your arms
To reach the end of the road
For his sins
Who’s running around?
I'll go outside
She’s next door
Your eyes
A gun for your phone
The up and coming tickets
The safe place
Even dance backwards
Seen from a distance
Don’t spare her memories
Waking up in the middle of the night
And smoke stains your eyes
Talking about my body
The deck does not help
Taking her away
And she wants to be there
What?
The midnight show
A girl full of silver
Got no respect for him
Call me cool
Come on in the darkness
The warm season
Aloha
Just wanna catch him if you can
Sniff on your fingernails
We’re all lying
The gutter
Your scarred voice
Called all your fairy tales
Starting here in a coffin
You hold on to what you say
I was born to ask you
Felt ready
That way ain't all I got
More and more creative
I think I need sex
Green plays shotgun
I owe your money
Sign my drink
Preserve the deepest blue
These dogs bark
Can't get upset
I know where this artist is at
We did it differently
When you're done
Feel the things within
No matter how fine I try
In a secret corner
And you’ve got a question mark
Always-living everybody
Lost it
You’re just joking
Your belief in a shadow
I’m gonna be home
That set the stage
Will no one spare you?
I can talk to you easily
He's never said another word
Would you leave me alone
Bad luck
The Bible
Wonder
I’ve lost my mind
Finally got a head start
He rode all night
I went to sleep watching
Why you want to dance?
I wanna eat your trash
Just his friends
Quiet places
And it’s wrong
Oh, hello night
Stranger in the wind
To live with kings
Hit me with a brick
I get tired of watching you
Her lungs go white
Throwing the turkey carcass
His messianic grandeur
Damaged friends
You will love me
And I feel nothing
Forgetting for a moment
Where to sing
Telling her we are friends
Just the week before my daydream
In the narrow courtyard
Find another way to die
And ask me that
My true love
But when it rains
Grabbing the freedom
No point in burning
Where's my diamond?
I wonder the future
He got crazy
The stars dance
Rolling fire
Slip my damn face
Rain falling down
Bringing the rain down
Hand me her sweet place
Can't seem to get over
White things
Long before I grow old
We are nothing but dead old people
My ear likes yours
I see you alright
I’ll pass
I’m your pride
I saw a sunrise
One fucking art source
Killing a boat
We're just fucking away
Love is a thousand different beasts
We'll find him
Hurt my brother
Doesn't matter what you say
Love stick me like a stick of nails
Like china
Dream our big name
The words die hard
Bottle of soul
You never knew
I don’t get it now
Minding his piece
I don’t have much left to say
Mouthwatering romance
To grow up
Totally home in his mind
About equal time
Flying the rainbow
And it’s doing fine
Born again
Not people you know
And that darkness
Search for clues
In a foreign land
Waving down a tree
Ask me, why I don’t go?
The kiss feels good
Throwing balls at you
That it is true
Changing your mind
And you left
Would you lie under the stars
Would I lie
If he brings it back tomorrow
Love is funny
You’ll never know
You gotta pick my brain
It's probably so cold now
The air never goes off
Wearing no shoes
It’s fucking alive
Walking out from your slumber
I only watch you naked
Take me down
Rainbows
Mother gets things done
To ask him the question
Eyes wide open
What I was good at
You’re one of our moviestars
I’m an electric driver
The swamp fills the night
A well-lit place
I will not forget
Anybody else?
Flying vinyl
I gotta make friends
Chasing me
You’ve got to get through it
Scales through my eyes
Try to come back
Here comes your talk
A nice flower
Irritating dreamers
You must win tomorrow
I'll feel so comfortable
Your imagination had me
I’m just turning my corner
Crushing his throne
His sips of poison
Is this brother an enemy of mine?
Leaving me young
Let me go
My first dream
To me you sound so old
Shine the love and sympathy
The closest you get
Got all these slippers
The world gets buried
You’ll find me
Show me your pride
Red talk
Take it easy
Set fire to me
You aren't very fat
Sitting up at night
I can’t wait to see you
No one starts out with you
Still lovin' beer
Underneath the heavy rain
Like a nest of snakes
Tried to catch you
In my dream
Raging my way
The battle between you
Don’t look down
Through some people
His days are forever
My smell swells
Smoke in the street
Not a cop
You’re a tortoise
An entirely different animal
So let's go
Slip down
No man
I know where I'm at
To destroy you
For a stroke of luck
I love it
You’re tired of lying
That's it’s okay
Do not be insincere
You’re just a poor cat
If you want to know
Hello from death
Straight away
Late to the party
Tune in for a run
The mind is beside you
He looks around you
Pulling through
Where she goes inside
A toy
Sunlit jailbird
Things that never change
I found you alive
Other song
Bad to the soul
Hit the wall
Within the shadows
Wait for the new day
From knowing the ancient fate
Cast a shadow
The water here, the bones under the paint
I won’t touch
No matter what tomorrow might be
When you’re pretty
Weren't we yesterday?
Somewhere I want you to be
An honest revelation
Down in darkness
Money’s no good
Please show me your love
The English Bird
My baby’s the one
I walk past you
When you emerge into the daylight
To search for my body
More like a home away from home
I'll use your friends
Let it be that way
Give up dreams
Open your heart
They get tired of me
My mother’s second hand
What will I do to your affection ?
Strayed in time
Freedom room
White is broken
Invent the new fable
Carrying the enemy out
Slapping his big brother
If I walked it in
Your dirty mind
To the land of the wild
Born you’re lonely
He gets from heartbreak
Bodies of love
Cover me
Join me, I need you
Mother and son’s juice
I always took my kiss
Rather than fight
That song you'd last love to sing
With unfettered love
My hands are broken
I want you to love me
I found something special
Over in the dungeon
Join the carnival
Made a bridge of silence
Convinced we're done
Pray for us
Taking on every creed
His name is Anna
Put me in my place
Shush the skin
You never stopped sobbing
The dark doors open
Where it gets harder
Take the leap
Cry Caroline
You can feel my arms around you
A lovable shit
Farewell to redefined cold depths
Can't be bothered with that
You’ve been waiting for me
Found paradise
Far from it
The last they’ve seen
The whole train wreck
What do you call me?
Hanging on his head
Mistakes you make
Fire
Spread my wings
In there
Don’t rush me around
Those assholes only get stupid
My time together
An incongruous destiny
The prison's broken and growing
Sick as hell
Love and danger
What I used to love
Hard on your face
Don't you want to be here?
Taking my ride
I saw she led me inside
Crying my name
Dressed up for the night
The inspiration made him lose it
A little blue hot
How well you're doing
Or describe what's missing
Sweep me
I'm lying
Pictures of faith
Woolly
Leave it on my mind
Hook it up
New store windows
You’ll find another statue
The nest of despair
Your door’s got one weird one
Live a different way
Walking to the sun
Music between her bars
Seems a good time
Got a whole new chapter
The good memories of wounded men
You know when you do
To me
Completely in pain
Take no interest in me
When my smiling eyes meet my shadow
Run like a man
We come so late
Just saying
A kindred spirit
This will crush you
Upon the craggy line
Be sure you’ve seen me
Throughneath
Your pretty eyes don’t hurt
These dead ends
What we have been waiting for
Sympathetic boy
Still gourd
Lost it up
No doubt
I don’t mean to judge
I’m tired
Yeah, that had been a bit heavy
I tell you what to believe
Need of a weapon
I can see you crying
Wherever I go
My darling
The tornado flashes
Stay away from me
Same deal
I’m your friend
Master, crazy
Your sister's wrestling style
The Satan worship begins
Fresh from the grave
Misadventures in madness
Hey, look at me and dance
Exorcise death
Somehow go down there
Off all the towns in the world
No, you know I know
You want me to see things
And now the blood boiling
Believe
Chasing interest
My soul on the border
Nothing other than a gun
I get around from where you got to
Put together the stones
Please fall asleep
But how you got there
For all this time
The pale army armor
She just turned away
You’re like me
You’re talking about the immense spark
Want the words
Where the heart really is
Living under fire
Then you sit next to me
The green earth
My tender earth
Long, thin drift
I know everything
Nice
Blood star
He’ll fly
Stoned to hell
Make way
For ten thousand years
My hero is God
New leader in the world
The Spirit’s giving way
Just mind you, all by myself
You’re a traitor
Say the support of my spirit
Before the wheels come off
Lost all control
What you’ve been waiting for
I’ve got you right
Piss me off
Your lovely little sister
So I don't feel so guilty’s here
My harmony
Over a month old
He’s getting paid
The change that has already been felt
Clear
I will be fine
In your sadness
You’re in love
Saw how much I loved you
Then why wait?
Where they belong
Like an angel
Things that do don't matter
Gave up already
Burning midnight
Remember my name
The adrenaline rush
I am not happy
A million miles away
Die before me
Rather play the music
The brainchild of my sins
Drinking here
Freedom of speech
Makes you feel so much better
That new hope
Music answers the judges
Frosty black machine
Burning in the night
Soaked up in loneliness
The king’s trees
Love and redemption
Live happily ever after
I'm a bird
Waiting for a boy
Sing in the moon
But they’re all safely parted
The ladykillers of chaos
I’m getting great at painting
I’m always like this
Back to the old ways
Rock in a box
Painted at night
Saw her touch
Took her for a ride
Locked within my soul
That's the way it should be
Just a little bit longer
With your sky
Here it is, in your heart
Her truck sashays her past
But the darkness’s a blot
Know that nobody’s watching
A bride, a shining love
The romance for you
You’re insane
Hey Mama
We pay for his milk
Big mistake
The shadows remain
In the form of a split second
Cry as I dance
Like holy water
What did you tell me?
My old alarm
And I’m in love
Until I lose my mind
The Pitiless War
Jet fish eyes
A song the insects of war
Too fucking complicated
You’re in the parade
Over every avenue
Milk for the eyes
Uggshells
That crime is holy
A loveable blonde boy
No problem
As I can only watch
Goodbye
Dancing with music
A beautiful painting
I’m really loving you
You want it right now
Low lying noise
Glass leaves water
Been looking for the time machine
Back up to hide
You’re looking through this slate
Put it on that shelf
I love him
A smiling baby
I’m gonna quit
They worked harder for you
You were the idol of the morning
Think nothing of life
Catch your face
New hope
Your father must be gone
Totally out in the open
Isn't this just a game show
I found myself so satisfied
Like always
That's part of the world
Our thirst for beer
And the fear?
I see her hands on my shoulder
We’ve got nothing to hide
This hatred is contagious
We won't be rid of you
Broke glass in a jar
Like I say
Believe in one belief
All you people you knew
Imprint the planet
That low wind brings you so much stress
A line of flowers
Speak with hearts on fire
I’m gonna stay
The moon
To make it out alive
One last midnight
Bite the heartstrings
Visions of painting
Pieces of my soul
That lead
I was born into the curse
A new way to say yes
The sun was shining
You are okay
Dirt got cleaned
The cutlass end that poured
He (a wild beast) needs a name
My soul’s a cloud
Good to see
Singing the song
Don’t walk like that
You’re supposed to be your king
The mirror screens
And smile again
Till the soul of his dreams starts to shake
It’s wonderful
The dream
The light is falling
Fools say you’re friends
Against all odds
Let me be your queen
Shuffle down my neck
All times long
Just to see you’ve said this before
Like a dream
And you want to kiss me
Just to calm down
Doing so is all over
Death of the unborn
Things you think
Reaching or keeping you way older
When there is nothing I can do
His hair on the ground
You’re mad at me
Lately
We should come together
Each of us is a part of our story
I’ve been ignored
I can't help it
Great thoughts
Place you in paradise
We could find a way
Sacrifice a unbreakable camel
Looking at the sky
Calm down now
Something bad in their eyes
They fought for what they had
Smells the same as your lips
Make it out of the blue
Desperate times
Knew he was crazy
Bastard at all
Ride and sing for eternity
Young crack dreams
The good feelings of my side
Without bells
Your lips are never free
Thoughts and chases
The only way
The river and the sun
My soul belongs on top
A timeless defeat
Change the brightness
Push the drum
I gave it to you in the rain
Like a beam on a pillow
The green glows
Memory it inside
After your death
Yeah so knowing I love you
And I see you
And that I feel I am getting
Beneath everything
Feeling the sun ruin
That will never do
Science behind building walls
Invite your family
His body is under fire
Saffron blankets
Your pride turned into pride
It’s almost time for a Christmas tree
Now you’re free
To make her hangover
But some won’t pay
Let her sing
Saw the figures of countless people
The other side
Such a tricky thing
Talking to you for free
Up on the freedom top of the star
Just like in the movies
While you hang in there
Sweet dreams of my hard-fought trade
Into a world that was only outside
Waking up as a tired dog
Make noise
Take every aspect of yourself
I looked down on my troubled youth
And the shells of times gone
I’m about to dive in
Find some understanding
Intrigue of innocence
Wanted to give someone
And you are satisfied
Fear me when I grow old
To the least
Burned in the ashes
A sigh
Two rings
Come out and just lay there
Kill the beautiful
Changing colours
Paint over this amusement
See the clear colour
The little island pirates
He’s never a good excuse
Sick of it all
Trying hard to survive
Drink's on my mind
While a dinosaur bird’s head falls
Stars smell of blood
We saw it all
Just now and then
Living in misery
Born in dreams
What are we doing now?
The haunted halls
Death by chance
And every sound you made
Blood
The sunken tomb
Now with them
Well it depends on where you're at
Ah, from Beneath the Wall
A pain in the stomach
Here in my side
Overhearing some funny notes
For ages
With the soldiers and killers
Say something wonderful
Then turn away, alright?
You don't need me
People almost saw
Water and mist
My way, go, go
Got lots of money
Your love is at last a clue
Mementos of the fat woman
Behind those asleep
What life’s all about
Lonely and lonely
Which door is the other side
Grown up fast
World and race
Crying all the time
You didn’t know
Paper butterflies
Gonna upset your neighbour
Let's see how you look
The day she can't quit
First time unheard of
Love my kid
Praying you'll succeed
Just open your eyes
Dismantling the weeds
Baby’s eyes are watering
It’s okay to make mistakes
Come inside me
The card I don’t have
We know something’s wrong
Heaven and earth are still moving
Sorry for sounding so out of it
Some buried treasure
Two sides of the same coin
While women keep running away
Aye to hell
The ship will sink on April solstice
You’ve never really had a thought
Black Dahlia
Someday maybe I will be
This baby
Take another picture
Burning it all down
Sweet sweet quarter
Death in his form
Calm down
Burning flesh from the saddle
Staring at the pillow
What if you don't want to go?
With hearts full of blood
Represented the mass dailies
Finds my friends
We look back at you
One sigh
Jump in the cage
Everybody must love
Beautiful to watch
Please leave me alone
Far away and better than you know
It’s a girl
Looks for nothing but luck
Love's onto you
Let go
To give a hand to Queen’s soup
Came on, come on
Sorry to be accused
The tentacle shakes
Calling myself the brokenhearted
I feel good
Your mind is nothing else
Move into the street
Where I come from
As long as I watch the country fall
On top of beautiful
Walking through life
Let's just kick the door down
Give me your tired-down
Rhyming
You’re ugly
Explain why you are a bad dancer
To pack you in
Anger flows down my spine
Exclaim the sky
Alive just in the grip of madness
All life is alright
Absolutely fucked off
All you got to say
His arms are warm
Becomes a part of you
What can I say?
What an incredible part
Like my little bones
Come on down in a door
Your nerves are getting up
Well done
Burner's ain't men
For my warm call
The simple way
Free me from my disappointments
All I know
Blow for the grave
Sailing by night
It’s half men
Steel
All men can do
In the sunlight
No danger
God damn things
The wildsman
Got the green paint
Know where they are
The reminders don't ring
Wherever you end up
Sweet and sweet
All you’ll ever see
Looking at you crying
This human condition
So he’s wearing a wig
Some white shoes
And you see a man
Told me everything
Caught in this time
You must belong
Gonna see how you want to work
Like the shadows
The game is over
Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
Where might we hide
It’s just down the line
Well, John Toques
Sounds more like a curse
Don't get me wrong
Walk down to a soulless corner
There was me and you
Can you tie me to a chair
When the enemy comes on the attack
To prove you men
Visions and memory
Time to grind
But there was hope
Come, come, come, come into that rush?
We’ll meet tomorrow
In a hurry
My time is too slow
At once confused and confused
Change your method
Throw him around like a trophy
A motherfucking mess of me
Sounds kind of dirty
I don’t know what else
I heard something strange
In between our lines
Somebody gets to die
When ever that moment comes true
Here's the place
Broke the lock
The common enemy
Me, too
A miracle
Undertale
Fake things
Playing tricks
Let's get there
Pretty much to control me
She’d leave a tape out
Our tongues fly
Blood drips down the street
She got a great taste
Let me hide from you
The name and the date
Making love
Spinning outward at night
Waiting to be taunted
While he always ran for her
Hide in your wings
Young cats
A truer word
He goes to sleep
Honey
You could be wrong
To watch money fly
A mask
Wall by wall
Pussy in the hood
Many are brave
Sitting by the mirror
Alone in a corner
Falling over
Let me die
Fall down
Like a few broken bottles
I was born to pass my time
The love you once shared
The rays of love
Dance with angels
We don’t talk much
Laughing cross free
I can dance naked
A lawn is being cleaned
Getting lost and never getting lost
Ornery trad songs
I'm not even a job
The distance is never free
That won't happen soon
Angel as glow in the moon
Jesus talks it over
One night
To a certain extent
A fine dress
Let's be friends
Your devil for me
Small fingerwork
We are in the line of attack
The end of the world
I know that
The times she came
Pretty boy, pretty boy
Hey angel
He’d take my life away
Killing rainbows
Nobody lives like you
Evil that keeps the city still
Star-shaped bowl
Try to change your mind
But all it took was a little fella singing
Fades out
One of those great kings
Sweet as the old butter
Life is about to get late
Too slow to call out your name
Really good things were known
That night feels still
Wanted it all for the third time
Yeah, as the morning opens
Join your sister
Dead or alive
Explain to us
The girl I wanted to be
And now that she thinks I can see
Young blood's wounds are running like hail
Break the rest of the world
A skull in your hand
Please don't let her
Into your cup of tea
Slip into despair
Bad as they were
Take my wheel
I kept her some distance
You can fix yourself
Find another reason
Lady sings
Sail away like a cloud
The smoke and the fire
A song
Knock on doors
Sweet, sour, and smokey
Flying over the air
Waiting for a sign
To serve the devil
Sweet smile
You’re a dream
Lying
Dark clouds seem insomniac
A lighter no less
Stand by me
Flying a light sigh
Talking freely
The dawning legends
Let's go
Our name is everything
His dark guilt
Everybody’s so perfect
In the crossroads
They say he’s my friend
We killed ourselves
I’m inside
Don’t like crying
The moon flutters
Soak it inside
If you don't care for me
Just be together for a month
All night and day
Excuse me but I’m doing it wrong
Still nothing in your hands
No matter how young
Fix the darkness
Love the highway
I'm on top
She never gave up
Of lost loved ones
But then it hit me
To pass my mind
Say yes to her
To sit alone in our honeymoon
In love
It will grow at the top
Keep making promises to the people
Crude and caustic
I could feel her tongue tingle
The moon in your eyes
And I slept it up
The reason you're not here
No damn job
Headfirst here
Scam for you
Crap that clings
A mellow voice
Sick of the racket
Jump for it
Trying to get it to leave me alone
Open your mouth
I mean the time and place
Shut up before you knew it
Let your loving heart dance
You tried so hard
I’m the fucking cloud
Awesome
Just a small fan
I'm hungry
The liquor is drinking
Reading what I hear
Pleasures at your feet
Slowing to adore
This can't be ignored
And my wicked tongue can sing
Ours is yet another boat
Soul still alive
Watching their wings burn
Prejudice still reverberates
Into the truth
The truth comes
Kill the bird
At the bottom of a noose
The picture is broken
Swing the knife in your hand
Broken all the walls
Real life teacher
If you grow up with art
Trans fats get wasted
Dust the earth
Love from the saddle
Without protection
Lost a thousand
Fly low
And I’ll be fine
A little under our wings
You’re still on the verge of getting higher
But you’ll go
Just walk in the sound
No longer and never will be
Grow up here
Twentyfour patches of paint
That never is too soon
Let me try out
It’s about here
He’s all yours
A pint of hard liquor
A brother room
Good for an accent
If you seem like me
Albeit it's kinda funny
Shaking your back
In the hospital
Add your clothes
The sky will cover
Feel so different
Your saint’s name
All the children's songs
Raise a storm
Tears of silence
Live a little longer
Drop dead slow
That bright sun of love
No one will stop me
Sudden fading away
If you don’t like it
Touch of eternal peace
A part of me
Up and down in a million ways
Very tender
I’m feeling sorry for you
Someday of my life
Poor me
I’ve made a dream
Way up here
Fly away
More by the wayside
I’ll be sober
Her miserable cry
To share that love
Of loving our singing
I’ve only got one thought
To know you're my friend
Just simply higher
Dance of horns
Invades the halls
Your blood hangs over the river
I'm afraid you’ll take me
Never getting up
No shame on you
Back when I was young
I always got it wrong
Turned down the street
Woolly whale
Lean for a walk
Common enemy
Through the show of time
All the rest are dead
The sound of footsteps
A big old, hardhat river
Blood comes down in veins
Across the sea
Life is pretty much the high priest
Be gentle
Your toys don't move
One thing that she deserves
Until now
Own my own dream
Shut me in
In a lost tongue
You’re on your own
But before this fading sunlight
Turning off your game
I'll do the same for you
Inspiration flying through your veins
Your eye should have been shining
Stone and sawdust
To order somebody else
Like you all
Get me out of my country
Lean on me
The photo kill
Watch as the summertime brightens
Directs myself from behind
What's the reason?
Tell me so
The violence that remains
I saw the power behind you
That were two ways to meet
Somebody calls me home
With wings dark and red
Where the law's been broken
Let's show what kind of hate we are
That brother
That my time isn't on the run
Fly on the sky
Getting hungry
In the land of snakes
Once again we fall into mist
Excerpted from one star in the sky
Like shit
Son of this day
Walk around trying to cheat
Oh I can feel the heat of the sun
Be like Mom on fire
Turning me down
And I’ll never stop
Things you didn’t know
Shadows of infamy
You’ll die in this world
Butts and paninis
Hey daddy
Rekindled my memories
In the band
Destroying a tune
What is a trick
A scene of fear
To see what’s around you
All right with you
Who doesn't believe in divine power?
Bones sway
Hiding in plain sight
Love's all too real
Find him pretty
His main feeder
Envision a beautiful world
She called me with a set
The past tense
It really hurts me
Can't help but cry
I'll die by your hand
Either another mile walk
Spoken every rhyme
Green mountains below
Visions of the sea
You’ll make me feel good
The fucking country will walk
Your ring of thunder
His face’s hidden away
Road to hell
When I finally got tired
Two big worries
They were never gentle
He couldn’t watch me
You’re the best boy
The lone word
Sitting there and looking down on you
I'm feeling so good
I’m feeling good
Nothing more
Come late
Live your dreams
They teach how to play
Who’s got your star?
But for a change
And I find myself waiting
She knows I have nothing to do
See on my face
Your broomstroke
This is destiny
After looking for this
One summer night
Life's too precious
We will eat together
All day you go
It didn't look like you’re there
Made up tales
Everything you need to know
He always pointed a camera on me
I am going nowhere
We had to be beside ourselves
It's mine
The moon is black
The band
Wouldn't be a mistake
Tired of going without you
End of process
Waiting for the rain
Somebody just followed me to your back
This has nothing to do with crying baby
Feeling away
You don’t do something
Stroll in
Confused
Where the wind is blowing
You’ve got half the weight
Your support
A smile on his face
Clones out his wings
Something for everyone
To come to me
Over and over again
Poppets’s world
You won’t walk
Brings tear apart my existence
Yeah you go
Just like the body can never catch
The cloud cut shadows
I'm going to meet you
Warm stuff to change
You won't seem the wiser
Leave her alone
Join me
Sleep, reflection and one soul
Out of fear
Ask her, when?
I’m of the future
Please start singing along
Killing all that nobody’s understanding
I do feel better
You’re going to be a gentleman
It was the night before
Another way to end things
Dilemma here
Feel the line
No one knows I’m the one
An anger-filled cave
Set your feet clean
Abandoned, shell-shocked, searching
We are going to need you
A message that appears in the blue skies
Trying to bounce
The alarm of yellow
In the open you must be a guest
A cloud in the sky
Golden in the sun
Little evil
With his still bleeding eye
Far away is the wall
And someday you will
Me too
The dead, the living, the hollow
Disconnect them all
Running down against your own wall
I wish you were here
I can feel it rising
Jump down the fucking hill
Change
Old love life
Behind the camera
Little Daisy dreams
Crossing the country
Sweeping thunder
I need the things
It’s not a good thing
My final destination
Far to go dead
Eat the tears I'm taking
What if it’s broken down and torn apart?
Love becomes foreign
How the memory wore on me
Sometimes I’m afraid
Both sides come together
Lie in silence
Bam it sounds like a stretch
My hair can be up in the air
Don’t expect to move so easily
Since I say there can be no fly
I've made your pretty name?
V’s still alive
Swings at a parade
May I stay like this?
I can’t hide behind
Dirty the powder
Let me stop
No justice at all
The name this city isn't called
Like you think you know
I’m done with them
Whitebird
More perfect creation
Kill her words
All around
Hunger, I’m a bubble
The nightmare has dragged on
Anywhere you could go
I believe it
Confusion
Rude with sweetnap
Money will never go where it needs to go
Hit me up again
Let's go back to our place
Voting for oil
Dogma
Move past the eyes
Show us in your dream
Stay warm
Her throne
Change the eyes
The caped crusader
The felling whale
Wet dream day
Destroying the truth
Absolutely fucking killer
Is this all just silly?
You stay away
Throwing away his work
For the tips
Giving it my all
Are we comfortable here?
Been crying and laughing in your head
It’s all life or nothing
I know it’s got nothing to do
I’ll throw you away
For the infamy
Let's go where the hell we belong
One question ahead
He knows who
It ain't looking good
Is everything good?
Today
Discovered your baby
Broke all my dream
Catch the street’s lights
Every fallen branch
One I look through
Full of gutter glue
Tried to make you look comfortable
Dreaming of someday
The new shreds
Used your false soap
Change the past
Whisper a street sobriety breath
In a thousand different ways
But what if your body was naked?
Feeling chills
Give me something
Exorcism
My years
Life was there
Erased the title
Light sweet things
And they go by
Dirty guest
Think of my body
Found fire from my fire
In his passing
Leave him alone
Born to find
Come aboard our dead planes
I know she’d not
They will be happy
When I tried to reach them
Where do you go now?
Confusing your fantasy
Push me through it
Say goodbye
Standing up for herself
Hate up on me
I believe I’m making a mess
Bikes running on the ground
It’s a crime
Saw the light
Lady’s trembling
That took a while to get over
The anarchy
Didn't move your game
Heart here
In jail cell
Glowing in your eyes
Shake it up
Once in a generation
Waiting for you to die
Sounds like a thousand other things
Close the book
Dirt from home
Like the wonder of love
They'll tear us apart
Going all over
The mysterious power
To the extreme
Here we go again
Distortion
I can burn ourselves up
Big lovable face
A funeral for him
They should at least give me the money
Burn her fire
Born to do it
Hooked in love
For live silver
She said we found a new sweet kiss
All the girllike gems
Say it to me
Things that I don’t mind
That floor
Love your heart
No one can control it
We both share
Lost from existence
Half blind
Dreams became permanent
Ever got lost
Is buried far away
Waiting for a scream
Roasting the ashes
You won’t get nowhere
Your mind is so full of simple blue
We go, go
Bragging
Heading into somebody's life
Blue sky
But the hand is weeping
Before your statue
I’m happy
You’re a red pill
Going wild
You ain't free
You wanna go home?
She’s for you
The sun has risen
Don’t call me old-fashioned
Want to be the master of my destiny
Across a barren beat
Pray to heaven
I’ll kick your ass a thousand times
It’s time for you
The blindman picture
Water in the sky
Deemed the love of my life
Cool out and remind us
You can't be me
Back again
Entangling himself
It just happened
Save me from this current dilemma
This alone
I’m a bit uneasy
Say it a thousand times
Everything you have known
Let's go down to Stonewall Cafeteria
You’re to blame
When I sat
I’m just wearing my bare feet
As I was thinking
Blood written like wax
Bound to decay
So I've been able to hide
Sounded like fun
Maybe it’s the same problem
Keep to the shore
Other people wanna cry
All the way through
Fly in one band
Man down
Take me away
To tease a little kid
Tell me what you meant to say
As good as these tits of yours
Point blank at me
White horse head
The jazz mood
Here the skies fall
Another story
Stranger troubles
Comfortable in the mouth
Time here I thought
A prize
In our battle-lines
He’s good to go
Just for you
Crumbling down
Should've buried the toys
I mean these things
Go inside
Too tired to have begun
Up right then and up there
The grass seed
Cried before
She kept crying
Free your soul
Long ago, you know
Like the sound of a time machine
How they were made
The muse’s sun
Living in the shadows
Drop down
Wiping the leaves
Hate, pity, hatred
The emptiness
Like heaven and hell
He was right
Forever running
Well that will be fair
The star is set
Dead giveth someone a reason
We gave up when you told us the news
Yesterday
The grass is blue
Snow over young white hairs
Slip on your hard time
I’ll never touch it
This is love in a glass coffin
The time has come to send
You forgot to pay the grandmaster
A room full of people
It’s true
Inside a moth
Build me a bridge
I wasn't dead
Blowing out my heart
Katherine of the suburbs
Wash the ship
Nine star attraction
I’m stuck
No questions asked
I’ll be glad I don’t go now
Dancing like music
Let the scene hold us forever
Like it’s good to see
A friend died
The beauty or the curse
Someone’s breaking that sound
They didn’t reveal their secrets
The baby is dying
You can see the laws
The feelings I went through
Wipe it all out of me
Come on!
About all your awful doings
Sick of that
Took you by your hand
Please just find me the one in your life
Wishing for the sun
Do you know me?
Suck the magic carpet
What you don’t know
How I had to sell my soul
Sipping a bottle
But then she passed out
Rejection comes with more finesse
This way’s all pretty
The lost road
My mouth is open to those who’re afraid
Come to ruin
A squirrel only grows up
I found an way to get in
It's never good
You’ll look great
The sky was not shaded
Ragged feet
When they let you in
Rose slippers
Disguised him
It’s out of habit
Peace is bringing men back
Then she had found me
My horns are rockin her ears
I’m leaving
A city on the brink
Some pain’s broken
Going down the white and red tunnels
Don’t come back here
My eyes shine
See your secret
I will move forwards
On the way home
Eyes on the floor
All I need now
Hang in there
Told you so, fucking shame
Down in this park
Anyhow
Down a path
What is it really?
What you’ve seen
Got paid
Hey, what's that really like?
The road has wide open
The man that haunts me
Down with abuse
You’re afraid
Well, you’re so late
No one knows what we found
Rising from the dead
You’re walking through circles
The safe zone
Falling apart
Pull me to you
Fallen angels
Maybe everybody loves you
Riding the mountains
My bones fit inside them
A voice inside my heart
You never walk through that door
You died pretty bad
With violence and love
The King of the south
Cutting and going through with it
Road to class
They come through what’s possible
All your scars
Return home
I could make you be so good
Run out and hide
Bound to nowhere
One minute you watch it again
Spinning in half
In every pose
What we had stood for
Fuckin down that road
Someone who can change in his name
I can’t watch
Under the half moon
Gave me grief
Look at the snake like you’ve never seen
Wish me a bigger red cloak
Even if the gave
And listen
The pure, mindless zeta ray
Using them as a commercial asset
Here tomorrow would be fine
Afraid to lose their love
The movie I came across
You don’t deserve to be around me
Sail me back home
Down to earth images
Till you shake
All men seem to love
Flying to the countryside
Peace and a ride away
It’s crazy how bad it gets
Hold my hands
Took her outside with me
We are so scared
Run round
Going down
Blue mist
And please mind your touch
Lie is a curse
No matter how afraid I get
She wants you to pick up your pieces
Up in hell
Great pair
But why not
Straight to the dead
Lost - lost
I'm afraid of this world
Everyone else's ring
I was new to the job
Screenshot my face
Hoping to cross the stars
Tomorrow would be fine
Changes to your voice
We just met
Then I knew
Find the children
In truth
The fountain and one-starlight
Yeah, there's some key
Waves shimmer around
But look at you
Dancing to the beat of your own drum
Don’t forget your cardigan
Live forever in the sky
You never can forget
I think
I wonder why
You were prepared
A colourless idol
The fading thunder
He told me
Crying now
Walk our corridors
If the sun shines on me
Giving into the fear
Got sick of singing
The voices of the souls
New music’s whistling
Man's way
Call me the madman
Everything looks awful
We’re young and want to fly
I’m standing here
I didn't need to be bothered
Misplaced money
Thoughts for some reason
The fucking highway's longer
And they broke it down
Here I go
Our worst enemy
My own voices
Today you can ride the dark forces
Madeleine from ours
Pretty princesses
The gorgeous Irish girls
Since you made me a bitch
Ain't a city of pigs
Yeah, alright
Locked in
Making fun of anybody
No toilet title: Red meat after blood
Street lights to the sides
True God
What are you doing today?
We won't give him away
You’ll never feel so nice
Looking at the stars
Great Light
Shadows everywhere
That made me bleed
Only feeling in the bag
With a secret heart
Spamming out everywhere
A place in hell
Carrying the king
Staying on the outside
Bought there in the deep blue
The dust is falling
That he would die
She’s in her last act
People wanna fly
Hit the open flame
So why don't you go today?
Putting her mind at ease
Baby, slow the blood fly
A nation of slaves
Worked like hell
Leave it with me
Forever speechless
You’re a waste of time
If we were angels
It’s all about them
And in my memory
Born on their nights
We come from the east
My frail sixth-floor
My heart I know
A bird of terror
You can touch a key
Sinking unguarded
All kinds of life trials
I mean to tell you a secret
He won't be soon
This is what you look for
It’s not wrong
Sometimes you’re an idiot
Will all the weeping be kept alive?
The flowers with winged wings
Nothing but silence
Changing my mind
Your next job
All the dead wings belong to her
Two footprints
She had no proof
Sweet old straight
Just for a name
Drop off
Listen on my ear
The smell of bad habits
To touch every corner
Better that you’re satisfied
When I say that first time
To fight the dragon
I’m on the move
Just teach me
We can. Like putting my mind on it
I have a crush
Bullying
Your sad shell
Sorry to disappoint
Through the dryer
Where it’s loud and proud
Tell my girl I have no name
Spooky horse
Even pendant and dog
You can feel so alive
Drawing electric
To give a shadow
Gilded, beautiful country
Now and then you look
Stranger
I know my life is over
She doesn’t love you
Stray to Paris
Let's not be afraid
More anger and dirt
We had lost control
How could you?
Playing with fire
I’ll never stay
Two little sad horses
What’s going to happen now?
Hey let's make it stop
Voices to entertain
She’s taking a fair share
That blew my mind
Born strong
Night in the sun
First time over long ago
Stars and starlit corridors
Inspire you
We’re doing it right
Still in love
Time burns like water
Everybody I know’s watching
Here we are laugh
Acorns for sung sirens
Dance to the tune of your heart
Wait for the rest of the world
You took no credit
On the roof
Are you going to fail me now?
Sun from behind
And to live forever
Shattering the toy
If you wish
God gave me so much
Poets sing songs of death
A place without anything but books
I hope you stay right next door
You say it with that feeling in your eyes
Put a smile on my face
Yes, right
Inspiring all your life
Buried treasure
My art gallery
Life-changing
May God help me
Playing and singing in the evening
We gave everything away
A clattering dance
People lie
With you down and with us
I never talked to the boy
It’s as if the world has no end
The night is dark
Because you’re sold
Take the girls for miles
Better hold your nose
He died young
Not knowing what to do
Another year or two
We’re both dead
With a smile
Evil Angel
Holy men who’re dying
It’s time to lay down
I still have dreams
And in the morning
I am still in your ways
They had no morals
It’s my dream
Welcome to paradise
Her bag
I think I’ve been getting kicked
Go ahead and run
Over my body
I am inside
Can't get enough
Dawning news
Out of control
Perfect old man
Ever forget your names
Two bars
Yeah they’re gonna keep doing
Falling for you
Weren't they very kind?
Afraid you'll burn me
He knew I was right
Someone asking you for a favour
Love to cause sorrow
You're mine
When you touch her eyes
When others cry
Can’t have you know
I have no trouble seeing
Sunshine town
Plastic toys
Going to keep running
Betrayal
Your ship is the planet
Talking to someone else
Say you want me to walk round
End the mission
I’ll be a pig
I’m doing nothing
The time had come
It's going to be awful
To prove you wrong
May be a prize
Just a beautiful parade
Don’t grow up
But you’re just there to be
Becoming a man
This call from heaven
Died of a wound
Silences get louder
Soon our money will come
A crowd
The crime scene
That bum whistles
Lie down in a room
On the moonlight
Getting no sleep
Tell the king of words
It looks like I’ve arrived
Hungry Sunday
Oh’s good to know
That keeps me alive
She said I met her yesterday
Through the mouth
Your house was built just the other day
Walking away
Pick your things
It’s fucked up
She didn't tell me all the answers
Your friend
You can live on the moon
Another battle
Wherever he’s lying
Sunk down on the park benches
Black hoodie
With blue eyes
The salvation in ashes
A torch is lit
Go honey, this way
God is beautiful
As long as I stay
Human intercourse
This child lives up to her name
Felt wrong
No more angels
Visions of mankind
Taking notes
Shadow threads of my dreams
He’s being crazy
Through the haze
The ground you laid down
Keep me still
Cry in the shade
You don’t know
Rolling my eyes
This isn't work
Dance and dance
The curse of the soul
Somewhere it’s alright
Future
Everyday life is empty
Hand-cuffed before we move on
And forget about me
No as in
All we made was for you
Only fade away
Human trafficking
It’s time for the moon
Come on you
Sometimes you’ll come home
Roast the game
Every place I’m gone
A glass of wine
Covered in mud
The fourth god
Buck, beat your teeth
What a time to be alive
Lady who won’t let me die
To paint down a statue
Ten different colours
Someone that everyone knows
A meteor ride
The peace that remains inside
Red roses bloom
Smell the sound of shining
Low on sweetness
At last I got my chance
The tearful wheel
Feel free
Down in the frozen cemetery
But I’ve got the red pill
The truth of life
All of them crying
I mean what is on your mind
Always been that way
I know she said
Everytime
Between us
Love loses a big shot
The devil will take my dead lips
The envy of each and every other
Looking in the future
For a present
Meteors wet spells
My beheaded title: Findings from eternity
Erecting a pitiful creation
Protect me from your ass
Under the tree
You’ve never been apart
In a clear room
This town might be free
Sailing home at night
Sleepy time
Can no one stop me?
While he's looking for you
Ever since she came to you
Satisfy my soul
A kite’s wings
Modern-day gangster
Feeling an affair with Jesus
I could teach you later
Here I come again
Yeah, they call me that
Protect her soul
A screamer
Seagulls of dark tales
Want to play the rules?
Our baby is fine
Their dreams never end
Save your soul
My destination
Any chance I can get
Lady's hand prints
Drink the good news
Come on down the road
Told to share
Displays the veil
She won’t lie
Your last feeling
Cut up in your hands
Up to that number
I don't want you to lie
Yes, this was right around the corner
I wanna kill you
War on the wall
My parents told me to do it again
I can see the memories
She began the dance
Reading down my tongue
Everybody and his fucking brother
I can’t go on until they see
Take apart my father
The wetter shore
I wonder how many bars there are?
Finally here I come
Little devil, you’re a rising star
Feeling abandoned
I don’t mind it
A storm of emotion
No one cared about you
Reading and loving
I know your dreams
In hope we will burn in hell
Make me believe in you
When there are no restrictions
Gave every move
Behind him
Gentlemen for a man
A busy time
I feel rotten
In order to remain sane
Infiltrate you
Uninvited from sight
First time unpack
Is that it?
He played me quite hard
His naked body
The tension keeps running through my veins
Desire to get laid
If I’ve never worked
We start again
I will take care of you
Supposing she’ll fall
All the laws
It’s hard to hide
Then there was pain
I'm so worried
Don’t cry
I'm not going to do it right here
Little hands lead me down to the banks
Narrow at the drop of a hat
And now they broke away
Take your watch out
Not lost in indecision
I’m never going to pick up my shoes
While he stands and waits
Worn out
He could not help but shout
If I can keep you
What men can do
The bell rings
This table
My sins
Toy and the treasure I am
No-one can feed me
Very well
The voices
Tired of stealing love
Just a dream
Is he starting to catch fire?
Next train up's attempt to cross
You know she’d follow me home
He’ll get a roll
Long reach in the cloud
We’re all insane
The open night walkaway
Live like fools
Learn about the law
Steal of attention
Iron and steel
The rain falls
Where you gonna go?
Hidden too hard
This is why I was afraid
From the mouth to the lips
Have all that oil and butter
Tired of getting down
Fools dream of success
Left to our own devices
Come on behind me
Talking of bombs
No ideas
Oh my goodness
Running down an empty stomach
Dark clouds parted
In the bottom of the sea
Everything up my sleeve
Sailing hard and fast
Couldn’t beat this song
Afterward
We're gonna get there
Things take a back seat
We don’t belong here
Instant and dying
Prey on people
Pulling each other apart
We've heard his name in the room
This land is yours
Until no one wants it
What I need
While we wait
I want my mind to wander
Twelve rap songs this time
When fate kills
You were looking down
Lost the hope
Falling asleep in your arms
Glowing sparks
Here in my city
Two colours
Tried to relate
Through the walls
Smells of smoke
The rain stops
Behind the pipe
Cry before the gods
I’ll move on
A witness to my misery
You’ve not been ruled the man
The scientific wiles
What you would like to know?
I'll never make you pay
The dream is my own
Bring back watermelon
Storing away my mistakes
Me and my island
Jumped too high
We go on sailing boards
I’m here to stay
Here's some news
Begging for blood
Broke my heart
Back in the shadows
We are the river
I knew you’d come
I’m meant to be
Ah, and he’ll touch my heart
Black strap
Come and go
Shhh’s off to hell
While I'm still in love
Those two words
Morning of love
They danced outside
Maybe she'll someday become a saint
Scary time
The age in the sky
Fall in love
You want it crazy
Turn and run
Dead men and sea children
We've been friends
I think I was alone
We’re all stuck together
Man next door
She’ll be left alone
We reach the middle of nowhere
The eyes of iron fools
Full of waste
And you laugh
Alive today
I’m wrong
See your money coming
Flying through the sky
Lighthearted attitude
I wanna go alive
We hear you’re blowing a match
More than a band of filth
In the depths
Young men laughing
Turn it off from dawn
Our time is on our feet
Wondering for life
I’m alive
I'm dying
One day I will be right here
Immortal
Where could we go?
The sweat remains
So he’s young
You’re crying
Still not yet cracked
Just share it
High priestly pose
All we've got to do
Mashed in holy hell
You’re crazy
And then he attacked
That immortal soul
You and I’ve met
Wondering why there is no tomorrow
He’s never gone
Trapped in a prison cell
Looking to the south
Want me on all this?
Dig more into my womb
Larking at the stars
This hand’s open
Your songs turned me on
Everybody finds their feet
Hit a saint
I feel like it’s time to say goodbye
Looking for somebody
No method of motion
Is not the right way
Didn't want to make your heart throw
Bad brother
I thought she didn't exist
See how high?
To cower so that the wind can blow
More quickly in time
A key in your game
I’m gonna break out tonight
The pipe dream
Tells me what tomorrow is
Deep inside my heart
In the moments of contempt
Place of power
With peace
Can only be sold by famous people
Watching music
Start some over
Would be out of time
The guards are still looking
Feel free to go
God’s gonna watch
New plain image
No longer has the control
Of mine
Somebody's got to move the train
Started buying to- pay attention
Didn't you know that?
As if they saw
Into the chaos
The dream you hold
Too heavy
But I always loved you
Pointed me in the right direction
He’s not gonna like it anymore
That is what they thought
Watched you smile
Entangled in an endless chain
Until he ends up with me
When we went across the street
I’m an old man
Watching for me
We’re just waiting for you
Milk the star project
Told in our bones
Resting low
Afraid I'm gonna cry
Each building comes full steam ahead
That you know
But there’s nothing you can do
The American in the wake of dying
Just be yourself
Very tired
Your acts just disappoint
A little bit of romance
Down in the room
Say no more
I'm doing it wrong
Don’t let up
Chasing you down
With it for you
Hot master fuck
Explain everything
Isn't it black?
Music to them
So what?
Don't cast it off in me
Through the cemetery
Search for our love
I'm gonna kill you
You’ve seen me stare
Four planes
To see the diamonds cut off my hair
About the law
And it went way too slow
Brings shame
Exhaling for the flesh
Freedom feels so beautiful
He loved you
Are the years of pursuit around you?
I love you forever
Don’t make me look
Hear me, all the time
You’ve been touched
I don’t care what he’s doing
Very fine
Suddenly awake
At all times
Without him
The boy love
Ten thousand kisses
Down with your butter-swinging leads
We wanna shoot the shit from below
Let him see why
The sun of some greatness
Protect from the cold
Travel a thousand miles
V-Day of consent
Your unholy drama
Climb on top of my head
Watching the sun set
See him be stronger than anyone
So sad
Ridden the road
Perfect protection
Ten corners of logic
Woe is me
Someone goes out
Freeing me and killing me
The true machine
Slow it down
No more explaining shit
You know who I’m gonna kill
Dancing through the gloom
Perfect shake
Welcome to the crazy land
And you’re the boss
Roaming the streets
Grow up and grow old
Take away the terror
Merry women get hired
Head to the room
The love you do
You may as well just go find yourself
From the garb of the night
With your new-found strength
I wonder what’s on my mind?
Dogshit
Red sea to the brim
Some man left somewhere
Bless the morning
Big secret
When they know you are there
Ready to be known
The sad life you come out of
To move there
But the nails that hang on my own knees
The attack became human history
Go throw it off
I'm gonna be tomorrow
Freedom of the will
A warning tomorrow
Move quickly dead oars
Realising why
You get low
I was so fucked with fucking power
That
He’s taken my wallet
No weakness
You are my role model
How bad can it be?
I won't feel the pain anymore
Join the battle
Wear your soul
Admired old swashbuckler
Trying to make the happy ones
We got some bad news
Drink the water
And is it guilt you need?
You’ll live forever
Won’t lose my share
The city is built around
The colorful shadow
Yes, really quite comfortably
Burned rainbows
The chain of command
Through and through
I love you, sweetie
Who gets home the best?
In honour of the past
I walk
Talk as a master
We’ll not be so old
I’m going nowhere
The girl that saw some shit
Lightning of a candle
Lonely wakes of my lovelorn world
One fell sword
That dark place
But I don’t care
Ugly look
What took you so long?
The truth’s all broken
Ain’t nobody’s role
The sounds of morning intermission
I’m standing there
Hey momma
It's cold here
Let them find you
The way you look at it
Me and all the enemies
His missing pocket
All my tears
Cutting through the lines
Forget that week
Dying only to go
I’m young
She smiled a secret
All our feelings
One new thing
The voice on the soundtrack
Nothing ever comes back
In her way
What do I get paid to do?
Throw it in the trash
Across your bony skull
That I'm afraid
To take you apart
Murder a friend
You could have paid a fine
On my eye
Be too young
Working on a painting
To get up
Sick and cold
To wake a broken heart
Buried somewhere else
Drink the ashes and pour the dew
Money for fame
She really loves to dance
Enough for them to hate
The world of hoeing
Much of your body is bleeding
So, I come to you as a wire
Looking inside
Like flowing colours
I wanted to cry
Check the rules
Whenever the night came light
Made of white paint
Sing the popular songs
Everybody around me
Will you ever stop?
Seen the good days
Everybody’s doing alright
Cool fellas with names
You don’t have the answer
Waiting for a burst
I can see you’ve got you
Shut up when I can’t finish
Swallow your tears
I’m forgetting everything
Why has it been so long since I did?
Love with all your own pieces
I hear the singing
Science down to earth
Connecting in my mind
See inside
Long alone
Spread my arms wide
Dead on end
Anything goes
I'm tired
Cry to the cop
All love
Save for a moment
Hoping for the wind
Laughs in the east
A dying soul
Wonderful prison
No way out
I think it's time to go?
Is everybody doing it?
Caught keeping your heart cracked
Flying bridge
Pretty skinny
What kind of sales do you know?
Watch me from behind
Much of the world is looking
Lonely keep waiting
Lost for a century
Ready to get crazy
Will it kill me?
Hoping for another day
At this time I'll be alone
The king of anything
Climbing in heaven
With another salute
Wintertime
Far from free
How did he get here?
Anything to help me get there
Roams the halls
We used to be kindred spirits
Return to your feet
Starving dreams
Things that make me laugh
Sleeping on the earth
Don’t trust me
Taught me so many things
To share my defeat with you
Entangling me in the sand
You see
Lovely times
In the room
Didn’t mean it
Her new smoke time
Makes you say goodbye
Talking to glassy dreams
The truth’s true
Holy blows in the style
Too much time is spent
Will your boss get up tomorrow?
Sick and sober
Behind the waves
Drowning all your dreams
To free myself
Shot in the head
I’ve seen you crying
Mist
The arboreal cat
Clear hair
If my money can't feed me
All her illusions
Throw their hats in the ring
I wonder how?
More blood for now
Back to making the place my dream
Lead a singing flight
I'm coming back tomorrow
Was that your king?
Want to stop and sit?
Maybe we could have it together?
Merry chimes
You never get to pick your wife
She'll lead
Please swallow my pride
I’ll be able to
Hear me out
I’m changing a life
Rapper of white stars
From my heart
A clue
Over in the mountain
People you’ll need to deal with
Her mind is here
Only son to the blessed
Oh yes please stop
Speak to me
Kissed my heart
Waiting for your master
Nowhere here to stay
Watching you struggle with booze
More than you ever could dream
Well, that has gone too far
The sea’s turned cloudy
Pray for me
I didn’t look so damn cute
Driving in the cold
That's why I came across you
My love for music
Fly by force
Hear it all over your shoulder
Can’t leave your own stalker
Green walls
I just get why
See all the gorgeous eyes
How he always pretends he found her
Glamorous looks
In isolation
A madman waiting for you
More heat please
I'm away
Your biggest mistake
I will be your role model
We never knew what we were
We landed safely
Yeah this time
Make it neat
Everybody else on the moon
I’m here to help
Get angry
Suffocating in silence
I will show you where it feels right
Hard and slow
My soul is burning
Tears into your bones
The sun can be yours
The way I see it
Bring you your spirit
Keep doing it
Your life could be a lie
To be alone in the sun
I believe you
They seem indecipherable
Oh no
What do you think?
So you’re free
Sounds like the place to fly
The rise of the tidal wave
Here I go new universe
The sun reflected
In and out
We are a gang of deceit
Sail that ship
So soft
Through the sand
My fear is righteous
Back to what I thought it meant
Tells me who’s watching
Got nothing to do
You’ll never see
You know you’re into it
Been quiet since we met
Something for the band
Got it together
We always lived at sea
You’ve no time to hide
Got into it with you
He’s brilliant
What matters here
I believe it but I ain't sure who
And then it is gone
Another fan
In most of the books
Pouring rainbows
One word in my life
They saw you’d sit there
Everybody gets their own way
Preserve the world
A time to cross the line
Lit it off
Your mother’s words
That holy summer night
The language of your skin
You’re fine
You look like you’d been here before
Will you love me a little more?
Every day I hide
On getting drunk
Shadow shift
They thought so
Found a roof
But you don’t go out here
Never surrender
I’m trying to be normal
I was tired of thinking
Oh, my mother’s son
Place
Above the times
Of your only pleasure
A place to rest
You’re weak
Written in an iron chair
The taste of sulfur
The dust in the air
Even deep in the tunnels
Roll and toss
Red infested carpet
My apologies
A firework structure
Who’s impressed?
Tell me a poem
They won't pay
The forest of fountains
I don’t love you
The sun will set at nine am
Here we are
Confrontation
Open the canyons
Remains caked in rain
To crawl all over the border
We need to hear you
I’m not so sure
Move my arms around
Some of you shine
A balance
Anything for sale
My brain doesn't know it’s wrong
Then a bowl of soup
Just look at you
Vanishing in my vision
You talk with the dog
Now I see where you come from
Staring down from the stage
Though darker than I am
She sees every little thing I'm doing
Well my pity
The sky is empty
Nudity
Little ears of a good laugh
I was right
Till I’m dead
Goes easy
Real busy
Then don’t try harder
Getting nervous
Suck in this jagged wall
The streams of something lonely
Just thinking about it
Son of sin
Shivering with emotion
Waiting for tomorrow
Why can't we just stop seeing?
To bring you together
Dead paper tiger
My breathing is broken
We’ve all been scared
How many times do I have to eat?
Do you like to play?
So why don't I have money to spend?
All these minutes of your time
Watch his hand on my shoulder
The future
I had their accent
A game changer
These assassins hate me
I’m fine
Sail from your dreams
It was just yesterday
Mouthpiece or facepiece?
Out of the weeds
Hard on my head
Made the center of the lot
Can you see it?
Running away
Disappeared
Stabbed into little pieces
The frog art book
Can we come together?
Baby
Up in the sky
Science
I’ve seen a boy
I think she's got a soul
Not quite how I feel
Won't let anybody else know
A shadow of that youth
Cut-off end
Why do you feel so sorry?
Holy virgin ocean
Yeah, I know what you mean
I never know who you are
Shadow my masterpiece
Still wanting me
Or I’m going to die
Don’t walk in the same room
Mind is a jumble
Grab a square
Make the world nice
The ring road
Selling so quickly
Violence, hate, violence
Paint your brain
America is a shark
Waiting to catch up
And yes, I know
